ABSTRACT
In this paper, we examine the relative forecast accuracy of
information markets versus expert aggregation. We 
leverage a unique data source of almost 2000 people"s subjective
probability judgments on 2003 US National Football League
games and compare with the market probabilities given
by two different information markets on exactly the same
events. We combine assessments of multiple experts via 
linear and logarithmic aggregation functions to form pooled
predictions. Prices in information markets are used to 
derive market predictions. Our results show that, at the same
time point ahead of the game, information markets provide
as accurate predictions as pooled expert assessments. In
screening pooled expert predictions, we find that arithmetic
average is a robust and efficient pooling function; 
weighting expert assessments according to their past performance
does not improve accuracy of pooled predictions; and 
logarithmic aggregation functions offer bolder predictions than
linear aggregation functions. The results provide insights
into the predictive performance of information markets, and
the relative merits of selecting among various opinion 
pooling methods.

1. INTRODUCTION
Forecasting is a ubiquitous endeavor in human societies.
For decades, scientists have been developing and exploring
various forecasting methods, which can be roughly divided
into statistical and non-statistical approaches. Statistical
approaches require not only the existence of enough 
historical data but also that past data contains valuable 
information about the future event. When these conditions can
not be met, non-statistical approaches that rely on 
judgmental information about the future event could be better
choices. One widely used non-statistical method is to elicit
opinions from experts. Since experts are not generally in
agreement, many belief aggregation methods have been 
proposed to combine expert opinions together and form a 
single prediction. These belief aggregation methods are called
opinion pools, which have been extensively studied in 
statistics [20, 24, 38], and management sciences [8, 9, 30, 31], and
applied in many domains such as group decision making [29]
and risk analysis [12].
With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets
have recently emerged as a promising non-statistical 
forecasting tool. Information markets (sometimes called 
prediction markets, idea markets, or event markets) are 
markets designed for aggregating information and making 
predictions about future events. To form the predictions, 
information markets tie payoffs of securities to outcomes of
events. For example, in an information market to predict
the result of a US professional National Football League
(NFL) game, say New England vs Carolina, the security
pays a certain amount of money per share to its holders if
and only if New England wins the game. Otherwise, it pays
off nothing. The security price before the game reflects the
consensus expectation of market traders about the 
probability of New England winning the game. Such markets
are becoming very popular. The Iowa Electronic Markets
(IEM) [2] are real-money futures markets to predict 
economic and political events such as elections. The 
Hollywood Stock Exchange (HSX) [3] is a virtual (play-money)
exchange for trading securities to forecast future box office
proceeds of new movies, and the outcomes of entertainment
awards, etc. TradeSports.com [7], a real-money betting 
exchange registered in Ireland, hosts markets for sports, 
political, entertainment, and financial events. The Foresight
Exchange (FX) [4] allows traders to wager play money on
unresolved scientific questions or other claims of public 
interest, and NewsFutures.com"s World News Exchange [1] has
58
popular sports and financial betting markets, also grounded
in a play-money currency.
Despite the popularity of information markets, one of the
most important questions to ask is: how accurately can 
information markets predict? Previous research in general
shows that information markets are remarkably accurate.
The political election markets at IEM predict the election
outcomes better than polls [16, 17, 18, 19]. Prices in HSX
and FX have been found to give as accurate or more 
accurate predictions than judgment of individual experts [33,
34, 37]. However, information markets have not been 
calibrated against opinion pools, except for Servan-Schreiber
et. al [36], in which the authors compare two information
markets against arithmetic average of expert opinions. Since
information markets, in nature, offer an adaptive and 
selforganized mechanism to aggregate opinions of market 
participants, it is interesting to compare them with existing
opinion pooling methods, to evaluate the performance of
information markets from another perspective. The 
comparison will provide beneficial guidance for practitioners to
choose the most appropriate method for their needs.
This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1)
As an initial attempt to compare information markets with
opinion pools of multiple experts, it leads to a better 
understanding of information markets and their promise as an
alternative institution for obtaining accurate forecasts; (2)
In screening opinion pools to be used in the comparison, we
cast insights into relative performances of different opinion
pools. In terms of prediction accuracy, we compare two 
information markets with several linear and logarithmic 
opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) at predicting the results of
NFL games. Our results show that at the same time point
ahead of the game, information markets provide as accurate
predictions as our carefully selected opinion pools. In 
selecting the opinion pools to be used in our comparison, we
find that arithmetic average is a robust and efficient pooling
function; weighting expert assessments according to their
past performances does not improve the prediction accuracy
of opinion pools; and LogOP offers bolder predictions than
LinOP. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 reviews popular opinion pooling methods. 
Section 3 introduces the basics of information markets. Data
sets and our analysis methods are described in Section 4.
We present results and analysis in Section 5, followed by
conclusions in Section 6.
2. REVIEW OF OPINION POOLS
Clemen and Winkler [12] classify opinion pooling 
methods into two broad categories: mathematical approaches
and behavioral approaches. In mathematical approaches,
the opinions of individual experts are expressed as 
subjective probability distributions over outcomes of an 
uncertain event. They are combined through various 
mathematical methods to form an aggregated probability 
distribution. Genest and Zidek [24] and French [20] provide 
comprehensive reviews of mathematical approaches. Mathematical
approaches can be further distinguished into axiomatic 
approaches and Bayesian approaches. Axiomatic approaches
apply prespecified functions that map expert opinions, 
expressed as a set of individual probability distributions, to
a single aggregated probability distribution. These 
pooling functions are justified using axioms or certain desirable
properties. Two of the most common pooling functions are
the linear opinion pool (LinOP) and the logarithmic opinion
pool (LogOP). Using LinOP, the aggregate probability 
distribution is a weighted arithmetic mean of individual 
probability distributions:
p(θ) =
n
i=1
wipi(θ), (1)
where pi(θ) is expert i"s probability distribution of uncertain
event θ, p(θ) represents the aggregate probability 
distribution, wi"s are weights for experts, which are usually 
nonnegative and sum to 1, and n is the number of experts. Using
LogOP, the aggregate probability distribution is a weighted
geometric mean of individual probability distributions:
p(θ) = k
n
i=1
pi(θ)wi
, (2)
where k is a normalization constant to ensure that the pooled
opinion is a probability distribution. Other axiomatic 
pooling methods often are extensions of LinOP [22], LogOP [23],
or both [13]. Winkler [39] and Morris [29, 30] establish the
early framework of Bayesian aggregation methods. Bayesian
approaches assume as if there is a decision maker who has a
prior probability distribution over event θ and a likelihood
function over expert opinions given the event. This decision
maker takes expert opinions as evidence and updates its 
priors over the event and opinions according to Bayes rule. The
resulted posterior probability distribution of θ is the pooled
opinion.
Behavioral approaches have been widely studied in the
field of group decision making and organizational 
behavior. The important assumption of behavioral approaches is
that, through exchanging opinions or information, experts
can eventually reach an equilibrium where further 
interaction won"t change their opinions. One of the best known
behavioral approaches is the Delphi technique [28]. 
Typically, this method and its variants do not allow open 
discussion, but each expert has chance to judge opinions of other
experts, and is given feedback. Experts then can reassess
their opinions and repeat the process until a consensus or a
smaller spread of opinions is achieved. Some other 
behavioral methods, such as the Nominal Group technique [14],
promote open discussions in controlled environments.
Each approach has its pros and cons. Axiomatic 
approaches are easy to use. But they don"t have a normative
basis to choose weights. In addition, several impossibility
results (e.g., Genest [21]) show that no aggregation 
function can satisfy all desired properties of an opinion pool,
unless the pooled opinion degenerates to a single individual
opinion, which effectively implies a dictator. Bayesian 
approaches are nicely based on the normative Bayesian 
framework. However, it is sometimes frustratingly difficult to 
apply because it requires either (1) constructing an obscenely
complex joint prior over the event and opinions (often 
impractical even in terms of storage / space complexity, not
to mention from an elicitation standpoint) or (2) making
strong assumptions about the prior, like conditional 
independence of experts. Behavior approaches allow experts to
dynamically improve their information and revise their 
opinions during interactions, but many of them are not fixed or
completely specified, and can"t guarantee convergence or 
repeatability.

3. HOW INFORMATION MARKETS WORK
Much of the enthusiasm for information markets stems
from Hayek hypothesis [26] and efficient market 
hypothesis [15]. Hayek, in his classic critique of central planning in
1940"s, claims that the price system in a competitive market
is a very efficient mechanism to aggregate dispersed 
information among market participants. The efficient market
hypothesis further states that, in an efficient market, the
price of a security almost instantly incorporates all 
available information. The market price summarizes all relevant
information across traders, hence is the market participants"
consensus expectation about the future value of the security.
Empirical evidence supports both hypotheses to a large 
extent [25, 27, 35]. Thus, when associating the value of a 
security with the outcome of an uncertain future event, market
price, by revealing the consensus expectation of the security
value, can indirectly predict the outcome of the event. This
idea gives rise to information markets.
For example, if we want to predict which team will win
the NFL game between New England and Carolina, an 
information market can trade a security $100 if New England
defeats Carolina, whose payoff per share at the end of the
game is specified as follow:
$100 if New England wins the game;
$0 otherwise.
The security price should roughly equal the expected payoff
of the security in an efficient market. The time value of
money usually can be ignored because durations of most
information markets are short. Assuming exposure to risk is
roughly equal for both outcomes, or that there are sufficient
effectively risk-neutral speculators in the market, the price
should not be biased by the risk attitudes of various players
in the market. Thus,
p = Pr(Patriots win) × 100 + [1 − Pr(Patriots win)] × 0,
where p is the price of the security $100 if New England
defeats Carolina and Pr(Patriots win) is the probability
that New England will win the game. Observing the security
price p before the game, we can derive Pr(Patriots win),
which is the market participants" collective prediction about
how likely it is that New England will win the game.
The above security is a winner-takes-all contract. It is
used when the event to be predicted is a discrete random
variable with disjoint outcomes (in this case binary). Its
price predicts the probability that a specific outcome will be
realized. When the outcome of a prediction problem can be
any value in a continuous interval, we can design a security
that pays its holder proportional to the realized value. This
kind of security is what Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] called
an index contract. It predicts the expected value of a 
future outcome. Many other aspects of a future event such as
median value of outcome can also be predicted in 
information markets by designing and trading different securities.
Wolfers and Zitzewitz [40] provide a summary of the main
types of securities traded in information markets and what
statistical properties they can predict. In practice, 
conceiving a security for a prediction problem is only one of the
many decisions in designing an effective information 
market. Spann and Skiera [37] propose an initial framework for
designing information markets.
4. DESIGN OF ANALYSIS
4.1 Data Sets
Our data sets cover 210 NFL games held between 
September 28th, 2003 and December 28th, 2003. NFL games are
very suitable for our purposes because: (1) two online 
exchanges and one online prediction contest already exist that
provide data on both information markets and the 
opinions of self-identified experts for the same set of games; (2)
the popularity of NFL games in the United States provides
natural incentives for people to participate in information
markets and/or the contest, which increases liquidity of 
information markets and improves the quality and number
of opinions in the contest; (3) intense media coverage and
analysis of the profiles and strengths of teams and 
individual players provide the public with much information so that
participants of information markets and the contest can be
viewed as knowledgeable regarding to the forecasting goal.
Information market data was acquired, by using a 
specially designed crawler program, from TradeSports.com"s
Football-NFL markets [7] and NewsFutures.com"s Sports
Exchange [1]. For each NFL game, both TradeSports and
NewsFutures have a winner-takes-all information market to
predict the game outcome. We introduce the design of the
two markets according to Spann and Skiera"s three steps for
designing an information market [37] as below.
• Choice of forecasting goal: Markets at both 
TradeSports and NewsFutures aim at predicting which one
of the two teams will win a NFL football game. They
trade similar winner-takes-all securities that pay off
100 if a team wins the game and 0 if it loses the game.
Small differences exist in how they deal with ties. In
the case of a tie, TradeSports will unwind all trades
that occurred and refund all exchange fees, but the
security is worth 50 in NewsFutures. Since the 
probability of a tie is usually very low (much less the 1%),
prices at both markets effectively represent the market
participants" consensus assessment of the probability
that the team will win.
• Incentive for participation and information 
revelation: TradeSports and NewsFutures use different
incentives for participation and information revelation.
TradeSports is a real-money exchange. A trader needs
to open and fund an account with a minimum of $100
to participate in the market. Both profits and losses
can occur as a result of trading activity. On the 
contrary, a trader can register at NewsFutures for free and
get 2000 units of Sport Exchange virtual money at the
time of registration. Traders at NewsFutures will not
incur any real financial loss. They can accumulate 
virtual money by trading securities. The virtual money
can then be used to bid for a few real prizes at 
NewsFutures" online shop.
• Financial market design: Both markets at 
TradeSports and NewsFutures use the continuous double
auction as their trading mechanism. TradeSports charges
a small fee on each security transaction and expiry,
while NewsFutures does not.
We can see that the main difference between two information
markets is real money vs. virtual money. Servan-Schreiber
60
et. al [36] have compared the effect of money on the 
performance of the two information markets and concluded that
the prediction accuracy of the two markets are at about the
same level. Not intending to compare these two markets,
we still use both markets in our analysis to ensure that our
findings are not accidental.
We obtain the opinions of 1966 self-identified experts for
NFL games from the ProbabilityFootball online contest [5],
one of several ProbabilitySports contests [6]. The contest is
free to enter. Participants of the contest are asked to enter
their subjective probability that a team will win a game
by noon on the day of the game. Importantly, the contest
evaluates the participants" performance via the quadratic
scoring rule:
s = 100 − 400 × Prob Lose2
, (3)
where s represents the score that a participant earns for the
game, and Prob Lose is the probability that the participant
assigns to the actual losing team. The quadratic score is
one of a family of so-called proper scoring rules that have
the property that an expert"s expected score is maximized
when the expert reports probabilities truthfully. For 
example, for a game team A vs. team B, if a player assigns 0.5 to
both team A and B, his/her score for the game is 0 no matter
which team wins. If he/she assigns 0.8 to team A and 0.2 to
team B, showing that he is confident in team A"s winning,
he/she will score 84 points for the game if team A wins, and
lose 156 points if team B wins. This quadratic scoring rule
rewards bold predictions that are right, but penalizes bold
predictions that turn out to be wrong. The top players, 
measured by accumulated scores over all games, win the prizes
of the contest. The suggested strategy at the contest 
website is to make picks for each game that match, as closely
as possible, the probabilities that each team will win. This
strategy is correct if the participant seeks to maximize 
expected score. However, as prizes are awarded only to the top
few winners, participants" goals are to maximize the 
probability of winning, not maximize expected score, resulting in a
slightly different and more risk-seeking optimization.1
Still,
as far as we are aware, this data offer the closest thing 
available to true subjective probability judgments from so many
people over so many public events that have corresponding
information markets.
4.2 Methods of Analysis
In order to compare the prediction accuracy of 
information markets and that of opinion pools, we proceed to derive
predictions from market data of TradeSports and 
NewsFutures, form pooled opinions using expert data from 
ProbabilityFootball contest, and specify the performance measures
to be used.
4.2.1 Deriving Predictions
For information markets, deriving predictions is 
straightforward. We can take the security price and divide it by
100 to get the market"s prediction of the probability that
a team will win. To match the time when participants at
the ProbabilityFootball contest are required to report their
probability assessments, we derive predictions using the last
trade price before noon on the day of the game. For more
1
Ideally, prizes would be awarded by lottery in proportion
to accumulated score.
than half of the games, this time is only about an hour 
earlier than the game starting time, while it is several hours
earlier for other games. Two sets of market predictions are
derived:
• NF: Prediction equals NewsFutures" last trade price
before noon of the game day divided by 100.
• TS: Prediction equals TradeSports" last trade price 
before noon of the game day divided by 100.
We apply LinOP and LogOP to ProbabilityFootball data
to obtain aggregate expert predictions. The reason that we
do not consider other aggregation methods include: (1) data
from ProbabilityFootball is only suitable for mathematical
pooling methods-we can rule out behavioral approaches,
(2) Bayesian aggregation requires us to make assumptions
about the prior probability distribution of game outcomes
and the likelihood function of expert opinions: given the
large number of games and participants, making reasonable
assumptions is difficult, and (3) for axiomatic approaches,
previous research has shown that simpler aggregation 
methods often perform better than more complex methods [12].
Because the output of LogOP is indeterminate if there are
probability assessments of both 0 and 1 (and because 
assessments of 0 and 1 are dictatorial using LogOP), we add
a small number 0.01 to an expert opinion if it is 0, and
subtract 0.01 from it if it is 1.
In pooling opinions, we consider two influencing factors:
weights of experts and number of expert opinions to be
pooled. For weights of experts, we experiment with equal
weights and performance-based weights. The 
performancebased weights are determined according to previous 
accumulated score in the contest. The score for each game is
calculated according to equation 3, the scoring rule used in
the ProbabilityFootball contest. For the first week, since no
previous scores are available, we choose equal weights. For
later weeks, we calculate accumulated past scores for each
player. Because the cumulative scores can be negative, we
shift everyone"s score if needed to ensure the weights are
non-negative. Thus,
wi =
cumulative scorei + shift
n
j=1(cumulative scorej + shift)
. (4)
where shift equals 0 if the smallest cumulative scorej is
non-negative, and equals the absolute value of the 
smallest cumulative scorej otherwise. For simplicity, we call
performance-weighted opinion pool as weighted, and equally
weighted opinion pool as unweighted. We will use them 
interchangeably in the remaining of the paper.
As for the number of opinions used in an opinion pool,
we form different opinion pools with different number of 
experts. Only the best performing experts are selected. For
example, to form an opinion pool with 20 expert opinions,
we choose the top 20 participants. Since there is no 
performance record for the first week, we use opinions of all 
participants in the first week. For week 2, we select opinions of
20 individuals whose scores in the first week are among the
top 20. For week 3, 20 individuals whose cumulative scores
of week 1 and 2 are among the top 20s are selected. Experts
are chosen in a similar way for later weeks. Thus, the top
20 participants can change from week to week.
The possible opinion pools, varied in pooling functions,
weighting methods, and number of expert opinions, are shown

in Table 1. Lin represents linear, and Log represents
Logarithmic. n is the number of expert opinions that are
pooled, and All indicates that all opinions are combined.
We use u to symbolize unweighted (equally weighted) 
opinion pools. w is used for weighted (performance-weighted)
opinion pools. Lin-All-u, the equally weighted LinOP with
all participants, is basically the arithmetic mean of all 
participants" opinions. Log-All-u is simply the geometric mean
of all opinions.
When a participant did not enter a prediction for a 
particular game, that participant was removed from the opinion
pool for that game. This contrasts with the 
ProbabilityFootball average reported on the contest website and used
by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], where unreported 
predictions were converted to 0.5 probability predictions.
4.2.2 Performance Measures
We use three common metrics to assess prediction 
accuracy of information markets and opinion pools. These 
measures have been used by Servan-Schreiber et. al [36] in 
evaluating the prediction accuracy of information markets.
1. Absolute Error = Prob Lose,
where Prob Lose is the probability assigned to the
eventual losing team. Absolute error simply measures
the difference between a perfect prediction (1 for 
winning team) and the actual prediction. A prediction
with lower absolute error is more accurate.
2. Quadratic Score = 100 − 400 × (Prob Lose2
).
Quadratic score is the scoring function that is used in
the ProbabilityFootball contest. It is a linear 
transformation of squared error, Prob Lose2
, which is one of
the mostly used metrics in evaluating forecasting 
accuracy. Quadratic score can be negative. A prediction
with higher quadratic score is more accurate.
3. Logarithmic Score = log(Prob W in),
where Prob W in is the probability assigned to the
eventual winning team. The logarithmic score, like
the quadratic score, is a proper scoring rule. A 
prediction with higher (less negative) logarithmic score is
more accurate.
5. EMPIRICAL RESULTS
5.1 Performance of Opinion Pools
Depending on how many opinions are used, there can be
numerous different opinion pools. We first examine the 
effect of number of opinions on prediction accuracy by forming
opinion pools with the number of expert opinions varying
from 1 to 960. In the ProbabilityFootball Competition, not
all 1966 registered participants provide their probability 
assessments for every game. 960 is the smallest number of
participants for all games. For each game, we sort experts
according to their accumulated quadratic score in previous
weeks. Predictions of the best performing n participants are
picked to form an opinion pool with n experts.
Figure 1 shows the prediction accuracy of LinOP and 
LogOP in terms of mean values of the three performance 
measures across all 210 games. We can see the following trends
in the figure.
1. Unweighted opinion pools and performance-weighted
opinion pools have similar levels of prediction 
accuracy, especially for LinOP.
2. For LinOP, increasing the number of experts in 
general increases or keeps the same the level of prediction
accuracy. When there are more than 200 experts, the
prediction accuracy of LinOP is stable regarding the
number of experts.
3. LogOP seems more accurate than LinOP in terms of
mean absolute error. But, using all other performance
measures, LinOP outperforms LogOP.
4. For LogOP, increasing the number of experts increases
the prediction accuracy at the beginning. But the
curves (including the points with all experts) for mean
quadratic score, and mean logarithmic score have slight
bell-shapes, which represent a decrease in prediction
accuracy when the number of experts is very large.
The curves for mean absolute error, on the other hand,
show a consistent increase of accuracy.
The first and second trend above imply that when using
LinOP, the simplest way, which has good prediction 
accuracy, is to average the opinions of all experts. Weighting
does not seem to improve performance. Selecting experts
according to past performance also does not help. It is a
very interesting observation that even if many participants
of the ProbabilityFootball contest do not provide accurate
individual predictions (they have negative quadratic scores
in the contest), including their opinions into the opinion pool
still increases the prediction accuracy. One explanation of
this phenomena could be that biases of individual judgment
can offset with each other when opinions are diverse, which
makes the pooled prediction more accurate.
The third trend presents a controversy. The relative 
prediction accuracy of LogOP and LinOP flips when using 
different accuracy measures. To investigate this disagreement,
we plot the absolute error of Log-All-u and Lin-All-u for each
game in Figure 2. When the absolute error of an opinion

pool for a game is less than 0.5, it means that the team 
favored by the opinion pool wins the game. If it is greater than
0.5, the underdog wins. Compared with Lin-All-u, Log-All-u
has lower absolute error when it is less than 0.5, and greater
absoluter error when it is greater than 0.5, which indicates
that predictions of Log-All-u are bolder, more close to 0 or 1,
than those of Lin-All-u. This is due to the nature of linear
and logarithmic aggregating functions. Because quadratic
score and logarithmic score penalize bold predictions that
are wrong, LogOP is less accurate when measured in these
terms.
Similar reasoning accounts for the fourth trend. When
there are more than 500 experts, increasing number of 
experts used in LogOP improves the prediction accuracy 
measured by absolute error, but worsens the accuracy measured
by the other two metrics. Examining expert opinions, we
find that participants who rank lower are more frequent in
offering extreme predictions (0 or 1) than those ranking high
in the list. When we increase the number of experts in an
opinion pool, we are incorporating more extreme predictions
into it. The resulting LogOP is bolder, and hence has lower
mean quadratic score and mean logarithmic score.
5.2 Comparison of Information Markets and
Opinion Pools
Through the first screening of various opinion pools, we 
select Lin-All-u, Log-All-u, Log-All-w, and Log-200-u to 
compare with predictions from information markets. Lin-All-u
as shown in Figure 1 can represent what LinOP can achieve.
However, the performance of LogOP is not consistent when
evaluated using different metrics. Log-All-u and Log-All-w
offer either the best or the worst predictions. Log-200-u, the
LogOP with the 200 top performing experts, provides more
stable predictions. We use all of the three to stand for the
performance of LogOP in our later comparison.
If a prediction of the probability that a team will win a
game, either from an opinion pool or an information 
market, is higher than 0.5, we say that the team is the predicted
favorite for the game. Table 2 presents the number and

of a total of 210 games. All four opinion pools correctly 
predict a similar number and percentage of games as NF and
TS. Since NF, TS, and the four opinion pools form their

day, information markets and opinion pools have 
comparable potential at the same time point.
We then take a closer look at prediction accuracy of 
information markets and opinion pools using the three 
performance measures. Table 3 displays mean values of these
measures over 210 games. Numbers in parentheses are 
standard errors, which estimate the standard deviation of the
mean. To take into consideration of skewness of 
distributions, we also report median values of accuracy measures in
Table 4. Judged by the mean values of accuracy measures
in Table 3, all methods have similar accuracy levels, with
NF and TS slightly better than the opinion pools. However,
the median values of accuracy measures indicate that 
LogAll-u and Log-All-w opinion pools are more accurate than
all other predictions.
We employ the randomization test [32] to study whether
the differences in prediction accuracy presented in Table 3
and Table 4 are statistically significant. The basic idea of
randomization test is that, by randomly swapping 
predictions of two methods numerous times, an empirical 
distribution for the difference of prediction accuracy can be 
constructed. Using this empirical distribution, we are then able
to evaluate that at what confidence level the observed 
difference reflects a real difference. For example, the mean
absolute error of NF is higher than that of Log-All-u by
0.0229, as shown in Table 3. To test whether this 
difference is statistically significant, we shuﬄe predictions from
two methods, randomly label half of predictions as NF and
the other half as Log-All-u, and compute the difference of
mean absolute error of the newly formed NF and Log-All-u
data. The above procedure is repeated 10,000 times. The
10,000 differences of mean absolute error results in an 
empirical distribution of the difference. Comparing our observed
difference, 0.0229, with this distribution, we find that the
observed difference is greater than 75.37% of the empirical
differences. This leads us to conclude that the difference of
mean absolute error between NF and Log-All-u is not 
statistically significant, if we choose the level of significance to
be 0.05.
Table 5 and Table 6 are results of randomization test for
mean and median differences respectively. Each cell of the
table is for two different prediction methods, represented by
name of the row and name of the column. The first lines
of table cells are results for absolute error. The second and
third lines are dedicated to quadratic score and logarithmic
score respectively. We can see that, in terms of mean values
of accuracy measures, the differences of all methods are not
statistically significant to any reasonable degree. When it

comes to median values of prediction accuracy, Log-All-u
outperforms Lin-All-u at a high confidence level.
These results indicate that differences in prediction 
accuracy between information markets and opinion pools are not
statistically significant. This may seem to contradict the 
result of Servan-Schreiber et. al [36], in which NewsFutures"s
information markets have been shown to provide 
statistically significantly more accurate predictions than the 
(unweighted) average of all ProbabilityFootball opinions. The
discrepancy emerges in dealing with missing data. Not all
1966 registered ProbabilityFootball participants offer 
probability assessments for each game. When a participant does
not provide a probability assessment for a game, the 
contest considers their prediction as 0.5.. This makes sense in
the context of the contest, since 0.5 always yields 0 quadratic
score. The ProbabilityFootball average reported on the 
contest website and used by Servan-Schreiber et. al includes
these 0.5 estimates. Instead, we remove participants from
games that they do not provide assessments, pooling only
the available opinions together. Our treatment increases the
prediction accuracy of Lin-All-u significantly.
6. CONCLUSIONS
With the fast growth of the Internet, information markets
have recently emerged as an alternative tool for predicting
future events. Previous research has shown that information
markets give as accurate or more accurate predictions than
individual experts and polls. However, information 
markets, as an adaptive mechanism to aggregate different 
opinions of market participants, have not been calibrated against
many belief aggregation methods. In this paper, we compare
prediction accuracy of information markets with linear and
logarithmic opinion pools (LinOP and LogOP) using 
predictions from two markets and 1966 individuals regarding the
outcomes of 210 American football games during the 2003
NFL season. In screening for representative opinion pools to
compare with information markets, we investigate the effect
of weights and number of experts on prediction accuracy.
Our results on both the comparison of information markets
and opinion pools and the relative performance of different
opinion pools are summarized as below.
1. At the same time point ahead of the events, 
information markets offer as accurate predictions as our
selected opinion pools.
We have selected four opinion pools to represent the
prediction accuracy level that LinOP and LogOP can
achieve. With all four performance metrics, our two 
information markets obtain similar prediction accuracy
as the four opinion pools.

2. The arithmetic average of all opinions (Lin-All-u) is a
simple, robust, and efficient opinion pool.
Simply averaging across all experts seems resulting in
better predictions than individual opinions and 
opinion pools with a few experts. It is quite robust in the
sense that even if the included individual predictions
are less accurate, averaging over all opinions still gives
better (or equally good) predictions.
3. Weighting expert opinions according to past 
performance does not seem to significantly improve 
prediction accuracy of either LinOP or LogOP.
Comparing performance-weighted opinion pools with
equally weighted opinion pools, we do not observe much
difference in terms of prediction accuracy. Since we
only use one performance-weighting method, 
calculating the weights according to past accumulated quadratic
score that participants earned, this might due to the
weighting method we chose.
4. LogOP yields bolder predictions than LinOP.
LogOP yields predictions that are closer to the 
extremes, 0 or 1.
An information markets is a self-organizing mechanism
for aggregating information and making predictions. 
Compared with opinion pools, it is less constrained by space
and time, and can eliminate the efforts to identify experts
and decide belief aggregation methods. But the advantages
do not compromise their prediction accuracy to any extent.
On the contrary, information markets can provide real-time
predictions, which are hardly achievable through resorting
to experts. In the future, we are interested in further 
exploring:
• Performance comparison of information markets with
other opinion pools and mathematical aggregation 
procedures.
In this paper, we only compare information markets
with two simple opinion pools, linear and logarithmic.
It will be meaningful to investigate their relative 
prediction accuracy with other belief aggregation methods
such as Bayesian approaches. There are also a number
of theoretical expert algorithms with proven worst-case
performance bounds [10] whose average-case or 
practical performance would be instructive to investigate.
• Whether defining expertise more narrowly can improve
predictions of opinion pools.
In our analysis, we broadly treat participants of the
ProbabilityFootball contest as experts in all games. If
we define expertise more narrowly, selecting experts
in certain football teams to predict games involving
these teams, will the predictions of opinion pools be
more accurate?
• The possibility of combining information markets with
other forecasting methods to achieve better prediction
accuracy.
Chen, Fine, and Huberman [11] use an information
market to determine the risk attitude of participants,
and then perform a nonlinear aggregation of their 
predictions based on their risk attitudes. The nonlinear
aggregation mechanism is shown to outperform both
the market and the best individual participants. It
is worthy of more attention whether information 
markets, as an alternative forecasting method, can be used
together with other methods to improve our 
predictions.
