ABSTRACT
With the growing use of dynamic web content generated from 
relational databases, traditional caching solutions for throughput and
latency improvements are ineffective. We describe a middleware
layer called Ganesh that reduces the volume of data transmitted
without semantic interpretation of queries or results. It achieves
this reduction through the use of cryptographic hashing to detect
similarities with previous results. These benefits do not require
any compromise of the strict consistency semantics provided by the
back-end database. Further, Ganesh does not require modifications
to applications, web servers, or database servers, and works with
closed-source applications and databases. Using two benchmarks
representative of dynamic web sites, measurements of our 
prototype show that it can increase end-to-end throughput by as much
as twofold for non-data intensive applications and by as much as
tenfold for data intensive ones.

1. INTRODUCTION
An increasing fraction of web content is dynamically generated
from back-end relational databases. Even when database content
remains unchanged, temporal locality of access cannot be exploited
because dynamic content is not cacheable by web browsers or by
intermediate caching servers such as Akamai mirrors. In a 
multitiered architecture, each web request can stress the WAN link 
between the web server and the database. This causes user 
experience to be highly variable because there is no caching to 
insulate the client from bursty loads. Previous attempts in caching 
dynamic database content have generally weakened transactional 
semantics [3, 4] or required application modifications [15, 34].
We report on a new solution that takes the form of a 
databaseagnostic middleware layer called Ganesh. Ganesh makes no effort
to semantically interpret the contents of queries or their results. 
Instead, it relies exclusively on cryptographic hashing to detect 
similarities with previous results. Hash-based similarity detection has
seen increasing use in distributed file systems [26, 36, 37] for 
improving performance on low-bandwidth networks. However, these
techniques have not been used for relational databases. Unlike
previous approaches that use generic methods to detect similarity,
Ganesh exploits the structure of relational database results to yield
superior performance improvement.
One faces at least three challenges in applying hash-based 
similarity detection to back-end databases. First, previous work in this
space has traditionally viewed storage content as uninterpreted bags
of bits with no internal structure. This allows hash-based 
techniques to operate on long, contiguous runs of data for maximum
effectiveness. In contrast, relational databases have rich internal
structure that may not be as amenable to hash-based similarity 
detection. Second, relational databases have very tight integrity and
consistency constraints that must not be compromised by the use
of hash-based techniques. Third, the source code of commercial
databases is typically not available. This is in contrast to previous
work which presumed availability of source code.
Our experiments show that Ganesh, while conceptually simple,
can improve performance significantly at bandwidths 
representative of today"s commercial Internet. On benchmarks modeling 
multitiered web applications, the throughput improvement was as high
as tenfold for data-intensive workloads. For workloads that were
not data-intensive, throughput improvements of up to twofold were
observed. Even when bandwidth was not a constraint, Ganesh had
low overhead and did not hurt performance. Our experiments also
confirm that exploiting the structure present in database results is
crucial to this performance improvement.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Dynamic Content Generation
As the World Wide Web has grown, many web sites have 
decentralized their data and functionality by pushing them to the edges
of the Internet. Today, eBusiness systems often use a three-tiered
architecture consisting of a front-end web server, an application
server, and a back-end database server. Figure 1 illustrates this
architecture. The first two tiers can be replicated close to a 
concentration of clients at the edge of the Internet. This improves user
experience by lowering end-to-end latency and reducing exposure

to backbone traffic congestion. It can also increase the availability
and scalability of web services.
Content that is generated dynamically from the back-end database
cannot be cached in the first two tiers. While databases can be 
easily replicated in a LAN, this is infeasible in a WAN because of
the difficult task of simultaneously providing strong consistency,
availability, and tolerance to network partitions [7]. As a result,
databases tend to be centralized to meet the strong consistency 
requirements of many eBusiness applications such as banking, 
finance, and online retailing [38]. Thus, the back-end database is
usually located far from many sets of first and second-tier nodes [2].
In the absence of both caching and replication, WAN bandwidth
can easily become a limiting factor in the performance and 
scalability of data-intensive applications.
2.2 Hash-Based Systems
Ganesh"s focus is on efficient transmission of results by 
discovering similarities with the results of previous queries. As SQL queries
can generate large results, hash-based techniques lend themselves
well to the problem of efficiently transferring these large results
across bandwidth constrained links.
The use of hash-based techniques to reduce the volume of data
transmitted has emerged as a common theme of many recent 
storage systems, as discussed in Section 8.2. These techniques rely
on some basic assumptions. Cryptographic hash functions are 
assumed to be collision-resistant. In other words, it is 
computationally intractable to find two inputs that hash to the same output. The
functions are also assumed to be one-way; that is, finding an 
input that results in a specific output is computationally infeasible.
Menezes et al. [23] provide more details about these assumptions.
The above assumptions allow hash-based systems to assume that
collisions do not occur. Hence, they are able to treat the hash of a
data item as its unique identifier. A collection of data items 
effectively becomes content-addressable, allowing a small hash to serve
as a codeword for a much larger data item in permanent storage or
network transmission.
The assumption that collisions are so rare as to be effectively
non-existent has recently come under fire [17]. However, as 
explained by Black [5], we believe that these issues do not form a
concern for Ganesh. All communication is between trusted parts
of the system and an adversary has no way to force Ganesh to 
accept invalid data. Further, Ganesh does not depend critically on any
specific hash function. While we currently use SHA-1, replacing it
with a different hash function would be simple. There would be
no impact on performance as stronger hash functions (e.g. 
SHA256) only add a few extra bytes and the generated hashes are still
orders of magnitude smaller than the data items they represent. No
re-hashing of permanent storage is required since Ganesh only uses
hashing on volatile data.
3. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
Ganesh exploits redundancy in the result stream to avoid 
transmitting result fragments that are already present at the query site.
Redundancy can arise naturally in many different ways. For 
example, a query repeated after a certain interval may return a different
result because of updates to the database; however, there may be
significant commonality between the two results. As another 
example, a user who is refining a search may generate a sequence
of queries with overlapping results. When Ganesh detects 
redundancy, it suppresses transmission of the corresponding result 
fragments. Instead, it transmits a much smaller digest of those 
fragments and lets the query site reconstruct the result through hash
lookup in a cache of previous results. In effect, Ganesh uses 
computation at the edges to reduce Internet communication.
Our description of Ganesh focuses on four aspects. We first 
explain our approach to detecting similarity in query results. Next,
we discuss how the Ganesh architecture is completely invisible to
all components of a multi-tier system. We then describe Ganesh"s
proxy-based approach and the dataflow for detecting similarity.
3.1 Detecting Similarity
One of the key design decisions in Ganesh is how similarity is
detected. There are many potential ways to decompose a result into
fragments. The optimal way is, of course, the one that results in the
smallest possible object for transmission for a given query"s results.
Finding this optimal decomposition is a difficult problem because
of the large space of possibilities and because the optimal choice
depends on many factors such as the contents of the query"s result,
the history of recent results, and the cache management algorithm.
When an object is opaque, the use of Rabin fingerprints [8, 30]
to detect common data between two objects has been successfully
shown in the past by systems such as LBFS [26] and CASPER [37].
Rabin fingerprinting uses a sliding window over the data to 
compute a rolling hash. Assuming that the hash function is uniformly
distributed, a chunk boundary is defined whenever the lower order
bits of the hash value equal some predetermined value. The 
number of lower order bits used defines the average chunk size. These
sub-divided chunks of the object become the unit of comparison for
detecting similarity between different objects.
As the locations of boundaries found by using Rabin fingerprints
is stochastically determined, they usually fail to align with any
structural properties of the underlying data. The algorithm 
therefore deals well with in-place updates, insertions and deletions. 
However, it performs poorly in the presence of any reordering of data.
Figure 2 shows an example where two results, A and B, 
consisting of three rows, have the same data but have different sort 
attributes. In the extreme case, Rabin fingerprinting might be unable
to find any similar data due to the way it detects chunk boundaries.
Fortunately, Ganesh can use domain specific knowledge for more
precise boundary detection. The information we exploit is that a
query"s result reflects the structure of a relational database where
all data is organized as tables and rows. It is therefore simple to
check for similarity with previous results at two granularities: first
the entire result, and then individual rows. The end of a row in a 
result serves as a natural chunk boundary. It is important to note that
using the tabular structure in results only involves shallow 
interpretation of the data. Ganesh does not perform any deeper semantic
interpretation such as understanding data types, result schema, or
integrity constraints.
Tuning Rabin fingerprinting for a workload can also be difficult.
If the average chunk size is too large, chunks can span multiple
result rows. However, selecting a smaller average chunk size 
increases the amount of metadata required to the describe the results.

Figure 2: Rabin Fingerprinting vs. Ganesh"s Chunking
This, in turn, would decrease the savings obtained via its use. 
Rabin fingerprinting also needs two computationally-expensive passes
over the data: once to determine chunk boundaries and one again to
generate cryptographic hashes for the chunks. Ganesh only needs
a single pass for hash generation as the chunk boundaries are 
provided by the data"s natural structure.
The performance comparison in Section 6 shows that Ganesh"s
row-based algorithm outperforms Rabin fingerprinting. Given that
previous work has already shown that Rabin fingerprinting 
performs better than gzip [26], we do not compare Ganesh to 
compression algorithms in this paper.
3.2 Transparency
The key factor influencing our design was the need for Ganesh
to be completely transparent to all components of a typical 
eBusiness system: web servers, application servers, and database servers.
Without this, Ganesh stands little chance of having a significant
real-world impact. Requiring modifications to any of the above
components would raise the barrier for entry of Ganesh into an 
existing system, and thus reduce its chances of adoption. Preserving
transparency is simplified by the fact that Ganesh is purely a 
performance enhancement, not a functionality or usability enhancement.
We chose agent interposition as the architectural approach to 
realizing our goal. This approach relies on the existence of a compact
programming interface that is already widely used by target 
software. It also relies on a mechanism to easily add new code without
disrupting existing module structure.
These conditions are easily met in our context because of the
popularity of Java as the programming language for eBusiness 
systems. The Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) API [32] allows
Java applications to access a wide variety of databases and even
other tabular data repositories such as flat files. Access to these
data sources is provided by JDBC drivers that translate between
the JDBC API and the database communication mechanism. 
Figure 3(a) shows how JDBC is typically used in an application.
As the JDBC interface is standardized, one can substitute one
JDBC driver for another without application modifications. The
JDBC driver thus becomes the natural module to exploit for code
interposition. As shown in Figure 3(b), the native JDBC driver is
replaced with a Ganesh JDBC driver that presents the same 
standardized interface. The Ganesh driver maintains an in-memory
cache of result fragments from previous queries and performs 
reassembly of results. At the database, we add a new process called
the Ganesh proxy. This proxy, which can be shared by multiple
front-end nodes, consists of two parts: code to detect similarity
in result fragments and the original native JDBC driver that 
communicates with the database. The use of a proxy at the database
makes Ganesh database-agnostic and simplifies prototyping and
experimentation. Ganesh is thus able to work with a wide range
of databases and applications, requiring no modifications to either.
3.3 Proxy-Based Caching

tion is to mediate communication between the application and the
remote database. It forwards queries, buffers entire results, and 
responds to application requests to view parts of results.
The Ganesh JDBC driver shown in Figure 3(b) presents the 
application with an interface identical to that provided by the native
driver. It provides the ability to reconstruct results from compact
hash-based descriptions sent by the proxy. To perform this 
reconstruction, the driver maintains an in-memory cache of 
recentlyreceived results. This cache is only used as a source of result 
fragments in reconstructing results. No attempt is made by the Ganesh
driver or proxy to track database updates. The lack of cache 
consistency does not hurt correctness as a description of the results is
always fetched from the proxy - at worst, there will be no 
performance benefit from using Ganesh. Stale data will simply be paged
out of the cache over time.
The Ganesh proxy accesses the database via the native JDBC
driver, which remains unchanged between Figures 3(a) and (b).
The database is thus completely unaware of the existence of the
proxy. The proxy does not examine any queries received from
the Ganesh driver but passes them to the native driver. Instead,
the proxy is responsible for inspecting database output received
from the native driver, detecting similar results, and generating
hash-based encodings of these results whenever enough similarity
is found. While this architecture does not decrease the load on a
database, as mentioned earlier in Section 2.1, it is much easier to
replicate databases for scalability in a LAN than in a WAN.
To generate a hash-based encoding, the proxy must be aware of
what result fragments are available in the Ganesh driver"s cache.
One approach is to be optimistic, and to assume that all result 
fragments are available. This will result in the smallest possible initial
transmission of a result. However, in cases where there is little
overlap with previous results, the Ganesh driver will have to make
many calls to the proxy during reconstruction to fetch missing 
result fragments. To avoid this situation, the proxy loosely tracks the
state of the Ganesh driver"s cache. Since both components are 
under our control, it is relatively simple to do this without resorting
to gray-box techniques or explicit communication for maintaining
cache coherence. Instead, the proxy simulates the Ganesh driver"s
cache management algorithm and uses this to maintain a list of
hashes for which the Ganesh driver is likely to possess the result
fragments. In case of mistracking, there will be no loss of 
correctness but there will be extra round-trip delays to fetch the missing
fragments. If the client detects loss of synchronization with the
proxy, it can ask the proxy to reset the state shared between them.
Also note that the proxy does not need to keep the result fragments
themselves, only their hashes. This allows the proxy to remain
scalable even when it is shared by many front-end nodes.

3.4 Encoding and Decoding Results
The Ganesh proxy receives database output as Java objects from
the native JDBC driver. It examines this output to see if a Java
object of type ResultSet is present. The JDBC interface uses
this data type to store results of database queries. If a ResultSet
object is found, it is shrunk as discussed below. All other Java
objects are passed through unmodified.
As discussed in Section 3.1, the proxy uses the row boundaries
defined in the ResultSet to partition it into fragments 
consisting of single result rows. All ResultSet objects are converted
into objects of a new type called RecipeResultSet. We use
the term recipe for this compact description of a database 
result because of its similarity to a file recipe in the CASPER file
system [37]. The conversion replaces each result fragment that is
likely to be present in the Ganesh driver"s cache by a SHA-1 hash
of that fragment. Previously unseen result fragments are retained
verbatim. The proxy also retains hashes for the new result 
fragments as they will be present in the driver"s cache in the future.
Note that the proxy only caches hashes for result fragments and
does not cache recipes.
The proxy constructs a RecipeResultSet by checking for
similarity at the entire result and then the row level. If the entire
result is predicted to be present in the Ganesh driver"s cache, the
RecipeResultSet is simply a single hash of the entire result.
Otherwise, it contains hashes for those rows predicted to be present
in that cache; all other rows are retained verbatim. If the proxy 
estimates an overall space savings, it will transmit the 
RecipeResultSet. Otherwise the original ResultSet is transmitted.
The RecipeResultSet objects are transformed back into 
ResultSet objects by the Ganesh driver. Figure 4 illustrates 
ResultSet handling at both ends. Each SHA-1 hash found in a
RecipeResultSet is looked up in the local cache of result 
fragments. On a hit, the hash is replaced by the corresponding 
fragment. On a miss, the driver contacts the Ganesh proxy to fetch the
fragment. All previously unseen result fragments that were retained
verbatim by the proxy are hashed and added to the result cache.
There should be very few misses if the proxy has accurately
tracked the Ganesh driver"s cache state. A future optimization would
be to batch the fetch of missing fragments. This would be valuable
when there are many small missing fragments in a high-latency
WAN. Once the transformation is complete, the fully reconstructed
ResultSet object is passed up to the application.
4. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
Three questions follow from the goals and design of Ganesh:
â€¢ First, can performance can be improved significantly by 
exploiting similarity across database results?
Benchmark Dataset Details
500,000 Users, 12,000 Stories
BBOARD 2.0 GB 3,298,000 Comments
AUCTION 1.3 GB 1,000,000 Users, 34,000 Items
Table 1: Benchmark Dataset Details
â€¢ Second, how important is Ganesh"s structural similarity 
detection relative to Rabin fingerprinting"s similarity detection?
â€¢ Third, is the overhead of the proxy-based design acceptable?
Our evaluation answers these question through controlled 
experiments with the Ganesh prototype. This section describes the 
benchmarks used, our evaluation procedure, and the experimental setup.
Results of the experiments are presented in Sections 5, 6, and 7.
4.1 Benchmarks
Our evaluation is based on two benchmarks [18] that have been
widely used by other researchers to evaluate various aspects of
multi-tier [27] and eBusiness architectures [9]. The first 
benchmark, BBOARD, is modeled after Slashdot, a technology-oriented
news site. The second benchmark, AUCTION, is modeled after
eBay, an online auction site. In both benchmarks, most content is
dynamically generated from information stored in a database. 
Details of the datasets used can be found in Table 1.
4.1.1 The BBOARD Benchmark
The BBOARD benchmark, also known as RUBBoS [18], 
models Slashdot, a popular technology-oriented web site. Slashdot 
aggregates links to news stories and other topics of interest found
elsewhere on the web. The site also serves as a bulletin board by
allowing users to comment on the posted stories in a threaded 
conversation form. It is not uncommon for a story to gather hundreds
of comments in a matter of hours. The BBOARD benchmark is 
similar to the site and models the activities of a user, including 
readonly operations such as browsing the stories of the day, browsing
story categories, and viewing comments as well as write operations
such as new user registration, adding and moderating comments,
and story submission.
The benchmark consists of three different phases: a short 
warmup phase, a runtime phase representing the main body of the 
workload, and a short cool-down phase. In this paper we only report
results from the runtime phase. The warm-up phase is important
in establishing dynamic system state, but measurements from that
phase are not significant for our evaluation. The cool-down phase
is solely for allowing the benchmark to shut down.
The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases are 2, 15, and 2
minutes respectively. The number of simulated clients were 400,
800, 1200, and 1600. The benchmark is available in a Java Servlets
and PHP version and has different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh
using the Java Servlets version and the Expanded dataset.
The BBOARD benchmark defines two different workloads. The
first, the Authoring mix, consists of 70% read-only operations and
30% read-write operations. The second, the Browsing mix, 
contains only read-only operations and does not update the database.
4.1.2 The AUCTION Benchmark
The AUCTION benchmark, also known as RUBiS [18], models
eBay, the online auction site. The eBay web site is used to buy
and sell items via an auction format. The main activities of a user
include browsing, selling, or bidding for items. Modeling the 
activities on this site, this benchmark includes read-only activities such
as browsing items by category and by region, as well as read-write

activities such as bidding for items, buying and selling items, and
leaving feedback.
As with BBOARD, the benchmark consists of three different phases.
The warm-up, runtime, and cool-down phases for this experiment
are 1.5, 15, and 1 minutes respectively. We tested Ganesh with
four client configurations where the number of test clients was set
to 400, 800, 1200, and 1600. The benchmark is available in a 
Enterprise Java Bean (EJB), Java Servlets, and PHP version and has
different datasets; we evaluated Ganesh with the Java Servlets 
version and the Expanded dataset.
The AUCTION benchmark defines two different workloads. The
first, the Bidding mix, consists of 70% read-only operations and
30% read-write operations. The second, the Browsing mix, 
contains only read-only operations and does not update the database.
4.2 Experimental Procedure
Both benchmarks involve a synthetic workload of clients 
accessing a web server. The number of clients emulated is an 
experimental parameter. Each emulated client runs an instance of the
benchmark in its own thread, using a matrix to transition between
different benchmark states. The matrix defines a stochastic model
with probabilities of transitioning between the different states that
represent typical user actions. An example transition is a user 
logging into the AUCTION system and then deciding on whether to
post an item for sale or bid on active auctions. Each client also
models user think time between requests. The think time is 
modeled as an exponential distribution with a mean of 7 seconds.
We evaluate Ganesh along two axes: number of clients and WAN
bandwidth. Higher loads are especially useful in understanding
Ganesh"s performance when the CPU or disk of the database server
or proxy is the limiting factor. A previous study has shown that 
approximately 50% of the wide-area Internet bottlenecks observed
had an available bandwidth under 10 Mb/s [1]. Based on this work,
we focus our evaluation on the WAN bandwidth of 5 Mb/s with
66 ms of round-trip latency, representative of severely constrained
network paths, and 20 Mb/s with 33 ms of round-trip latency, 
representative of a moderately constrained network path. We also report
Ganesh"s performance at 100 Mb/s with no added round-trip 
latency. This bandwidth, representative of an unconstrained network,
is especially useful in revealing any potential overhead of Ganesh
in situations where WAN bandwidth is not the limiting factor. For
each combination of number of clients and WAN bandwidth, we
measured results from the two configurations listed below:
â€¢ Native: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(a). 
Native avoids Ganesh"s overhead in using a proxy and 
performing Java object serialization.
â€¢ Ganesh: This configuration corresponds to Figure 3(b). For
a given number of clients and WAN bandwidth, comparing
these results to the corresponding Native results gives the
performance benefit due to the Ganesh middleware system.
The metric used to quantify the improvement in throughput is
the number of client requests that can be serviced per second. The
metric used to quantify Ganesh"s overhead is the average response
time for a client request. For all of the experiments, the Ganesh
driver used by the application server used a cache size of 100,000
items1
. The proxy was effective in tracking the Ganesh driver"s
cache state; for all of our experiments the miss rate on the driver
never exceeded 0.7%.
4.3 Experimental Setup
The experimental setup used for the benchmarks can be seen in
Figure 5. All machines were 3.2 GHz Pentium 4s (with 
HyperThreading enabled.) With the exception of the database server, all
machines had 2 GB of SDRAM and ran the Fedora Core Linux
distribution. The database server had 4 GB of SDRAM.
We used Apache"s Tomcat as both the application server that
hosted the Java Servlets and the web server. Both benchmarks
used Java Servlets to generate the dynamic content. The database
server used the open source MySQL database. For the native JDBC
drivers, we used the Connector/J drivers provided by MySQL. The
application server used Sun"s Java Virtual Machine as the runtime
environment for the Java Servlets. The sysstat tool was used to
monitor the CPU, network, disk, and memory utilization on all 
machines.
The machines were connected by a switched gigabit Ethernet
network. As shown in Figure 5, the front-end web and 
application server was separated from the proxy and database server by a
NetEm router [16]. This router allowed us to control the bandwidth
and latency settings on the network. The NetEm router is a 
standard PC with two network cards running the Linux Traffic Control
and Network Emulation software. The bandwidth and latency 
constraints were only applied to the link between the application server
and the database for the native case and between the application
server and the proxy for the Ganesh case. There is no 
communication between the application server and the database with Ganesh
as all data flows through the proxy. As our focus was on the WAN
link between the application server and the database, there were no
constraints on the link between the simulated test clients and the
web server.
5. THROUGHPUT AND RESPONSE TIME
In this section, we address the first question raised in Section 4:
Can performance can be improved significantly by exploiting 
similarity across database results? To answer this question, we use
results from the BBOARD and AUCTION benchmarks. We use
two metrics to quantify the performance improvement obtainable
through the use of Ganesh: throughput, from the perspective of the
web server, and average response time, from the perspective of the
client. Throughput is measured in terms of the number of client
requests that can be serviced per second.
5.1 BBOARD Results and Analysis
5.1.1 Authoring Mix
Figures 6 (a) and (b) present the average number of requests 
serviced per second and the average response time for these requests
as perceived by the clients for BBOARD"s Authoring Mix.
As Figure 6 (a) shows, Native easily saturates the 5 Mb/s link.
At 400 clients, the Native solution delivers 29 requests/sec with an
average response time of 8.3 seconds. Native"s throughput drops
with an increase in test clients as clients timeout due to 
congestion at the application server. Usability studies have shown that
response times above 10 seconds cause the user to move on to
1
As Java lacks a sizeof() operator, Java caches therefore limit
their size based on the number of objects. The size of cache dumps
taken at the end of the experiments never exceeded 212 MB.

5 Mb/s, however, delivers a twofold improvement with 400 test
clients and a fivefold improvement at 1200 clients. Ganesh"s 
performance drops slightly at 1200 and 1600 clients as the network is
saturated. Compared to Native, Figure 6 (b) shows that Ganesh"s
response times are substantially lower with sub-second response
times at 400 clients.
Figure 6 (a) also shows that for 400 and 800 test clients Ganesh
at 5 Mb/s has the same throughput and average response time as
Native at 20 Mb/s. Only at 1200 and 1600 clients does Native at 20
Mb/s deliver higher throughput than Ganesh at 5 Mb/s.
Comparing both Ganesh and Native at 20 Mb/s, we see that
Ganesh is no longer bandwidth constrained and delivers up to a
twofold improvement over Native at 1600 test clients. As Ganesh
does not saturate the network with higher test client configurations,
at 1600 test clients, its average response time is 0.1 seconds rather
than Native"s 7.7 seconds.
As expected, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at the higher
bandwidth of 100 Mb/s where the network is no longer the 
bottleneck. Ganesh, however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput.
5.1.2 Browsing Mix
Figures 6 (c) and (d) present the average number of requests 
serviced per second and the average response time for these requests
as perceived by the clients for BBOARD"s Browsing Mix.
Regardless of the test client configuration, Figure 6 (c) shows
that Native"s throughput at 5 Mb/s is limited to 10 reqs/sec. Ganesh
at 5 Mb/s with 400 test clients, delivers more than a sixfold 
increase in throughput. The improvement increases to over a 
elevenfold increase at 800 test clients before Ganesh saturates the 
network. Further, Figure 6 (d) shows that Native"s average response
time of 35 seconds at 400 test clients make the system unusable.
These high response times further increase with the addition of test
clients. Even with the 1600 test client configuration Ganesh 
delivers an acceptable average response time of 8.2 seconds.
Due to the data-intensive nature of the Browsing mix, Ganesh at
5 Mb/s surprisingly performs much better than Native at 20 Mb/s.
Further, as shown in Figure 6 (d), while the average response time
for Native at 20 Mb/s is acceptable at 400 test clients, it is unusable
with 800 test clients with an average response time of 15.8 seconds.
Like the 5 Mb/s case, this response time increases with the addition
of extra test clients.
Ganesh at 20 Mb/s and both Native and Ganesh at 100 Mb/s are
not bandwidth limited. However, performance plateaus out after
1200 test clients due to the database CPU being saturated.
5.1.3 Filter Variant
We were surprised by the Native performance from the BBOARD
benchmark. At the bandwidth of 5 Mb/s, Native performance was
lower than what we had expected. It turned out the benchmark
code that displays stories read all the comments associated with
the particular story from the database and only then did some 
postprocessing to select the comments to be displayed. While this is
exactly the behavior of SlashCode, the code base behind the 
Slashdot web site, we decided to modify the benchmark to perform some
pre-filtering at the database. This modified benchmark, named the
Filter Variant, models a developer who applies optimizations at the
SQL level to transfer less data. In the interests of brevity, we only
briefly summarize the results from the Authoring mix.
For the Authoring mix, at 800 test clients at 5 Mb/s, Figure 7 (a)
shows that Native"s throughput increase by 85% when compared
to the original benchmark while Ganesh"s improvement is smaller
at 15%. Native"s performance drops above 800 clients as the test
clients time out due to high response times. The most significant
gain for Native is seen at 20 Mb/s. At 1600 test clients, when 
compared to the original benchmark, Native sees a 73% improvement
in throughput and a 77% reduction in average response time. While

Ganesh sees no improvement when compared to the original, it still
processes 19% more requests/sec than Native. Thus, while the 
optimizations were more helpful to Native, Ganesh still delivers an
improvement in performance.
5.2 AUCTION Results and Analysis
5.2.1 Bidding Mix
Figures 8 (a) and (b) present the average number of requests 
serviced per second and the average response time for these requests
as perceived by the clients for AUCTION"s Bidding Mix. As 
mentioned earlier, the Bidding mix consists of a mixture of read and
write operations.
The AUCTION benchmark is not as data intensive as BBOARD.
Therefore, most of the gains are observed at the lower bandwidth
of 5 Mb/s. Figure 8 (a) shows that the increase in throughput due
to Ganesh ranges from 8% at 400 test clients to 18% with 1600
test clients. As seen in Figure 8 (b), the average response times for
Ganesh are significantly lower than Native ranging from a decrease
of 84% at 800 test clients to 88% at 1600 test clients.
Figure 8 (a) also shows that with a fourfold increase of 
bandwidth from 5 Mb/s to 20 Mb/s, Native is no longer bandwidth 
constrained and there is no performance difference between Ganesh
and Native. With the higher test client configurations, we did 
observe that the bandwidth used by Ganesh was lower than Native.
Ganesh might still be useful in these non-constrained scenarios if
bandwidth is purchased on a metered basis. Similar results are seen
for the 100 Mb/s scenario.
5.2.2 Browsing Mix
For AUCTION"s Browsing Mix, Figures 8 (c) and (d) present the
average number of requests serviced per second and the average
response time for these requests as perceived by the clients.
Again, most of the gains are observed at lower bandwidths. At 5
Mb/s, Native and Ganesh deliver similar throughput and response
times with 400 test clients. While the throughput for both remains
the same at 800 test clients, Figure 8 (d) shows that Ganesh"s 
average response time is 62% lower than Native. Native saturates the
link at 800 clients and adding extra test clients only increases the
average response time. Ganesh, regardless of the test client 
configuration, is not bandwidth constrained and maintains the same 
response time. At 1600 test clients, Figure 8 (c) shows that Ganesh"s
throughput is almost twice that of Native.
At the higher bandwidths of 20 and 100 Mb/s, neither Ganesh
nor Native is bandwidth limited and deliver equivalent throughput
and response times.

Table 2: Similarity Microbenchmarks
6. STRUCTURAL VS. RABIN SIMILARITY
In this section, we address the second question raised in 
Section 4: How important is Ganesh"s structural similarity detection
relative to Rabin fingerprinting-based similarity detecting? To 
answer this question, we used microbenchmarks and the BBOARD and
AUCTION benchmarks. As Ganesh always performed better than
Rabin fingerprinting, we only present a subset of the results here in
the interests of brevity.
6.1 Microbenchmarks
Two microbenchmarks show an example of the effects of data
reordering on Rabin fingerprinting algorithm. In the first 
microbenchmark, SelectSort1, a query with a specified sort order selects
223.6 MB of data spread over approximately 280 K rows. The
query is then repeated with a different sort attribute. While the
same number of rows and the same data is returned, the order of
rows is different. In such a scenario, one would expect a large
amount of similarity to be detected between both results. As 
Table 2 shows, Ganesh"s row-based algorithm achieves a 97.6% 
reduction while the Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, with the average
chunk size parameter set to 4 KB, only achieves a 1% reduction.
The reason, as shown earlier in Figure 2, is that with Rabin 
fingerprinting, the spans of data between two consecutive boundaries
usually cross row boundaries. With the order of the rows changing
in the second result and the Rabin fingerprints now spanning 
different rows, the algorithm is unable to detect significant similarity.
The small gain seen is mostly for those single rows that are large
enough to be broken into multiple chunks.
SelectSort2, another micro-benchmark executed the same queries
but increased the minimum chunk size of the Rabin fingerprinting
algorithm. As can be seen in Table 2, even the small gain from the
previous microbenchmark disappears as the minimum chunk size
was greater than the average row size. While one can partially 
address these problems by dynamically varying the parameters of the
Rabin fingerprinting algorithm, this can be computationally 
expensive, especially in the presence of changing workloads.
6.2 Application Benchmarks
We ran the BBOARD benchmark described in Section 4.1.1 on
two versions of Ganesh: the first with Rabin fingerprinting used as

the chunking algorithm and the second with Ganesh"s row-based
algorithm. Rabin"s results for the Browsing Mix are normalized to
Ganesh"s results and presented in Figure 9.
As Figure 9 (a) shows, at 5 Mb/s, independent of the test client
configuration, Rabin significantly underperforms Ganesh. This 
happens because of a combination of two reasons. First, as outlined
in Section 3.1, Rabin finds less similarity as it does not exploit
the result"s structural information. Second, this benchmark 
contained some queries that generated large results. In this case, 
Rabin, with a small average chunk size, generated a large number of
objects that evicted other useful data from the cache. In contrast,
Ganesh was able to detect these large rows and correspondingly
increase the size of the chunks. This was confirmed as cache 
statistics showed that Ganesh"s hit ratio was roughly three time that of
Rabin. Throughput measurements at 20 Mb/s were similar with
the exception of Rabin"s performance with 400 test clients. In this
case, Ganesh was not network limited and, in fact, the throughput
was the same as 400 clients at 5 Mb/s. Rabin, however, took 
advantage of the bandwidth increase from 5 to 20 Mb/s to deliver a
slightly better performance. At 100 Mb/s, Rabin"s throughput was
almost similar to Ganesh as bandwidth was no longer a bottleneck.
The normalized response time, presented in Figure 9 (b), shows
similar trends. At 5 and 20 Mb/s, the addition of test clients 
decreases the normalized response time as Ganesh"s average response
time increases faster than Rabin"s. However, at no point does Rabin
outperform Ganesh. Note that at 400 and 800 clients at 100 Mb/s,
Rabin does have a higher overhead even when it is not bandwidth
constrained. As mentioned in Section 3.1, this is due to the fact that
Rabin has to hash each ResultSet twice. The overhead 
disappears with 1200 and 1600 clients as the database CPU is saturated
and limits the performance of both Ganesh and Rabin.
7. PROXY OVERHEAD
In this section, we address the third question raised in Section 4:
Is the overhead of Ganesh"s proxy-based design acceptable? To 
answer this question, we concentrate on its performance at the higher
bandwidths. Our evaluation in Section 5 showed that Ganesh, when
compared to Native, can deliver a substantial throughput 
improvement at lower bandwidths. It is only at higher bandwidths that 
latency, measured by the average response time for a client request,
and throughput, measured by the number of client requests that can
be serviced per second, overheads would be visible.
Looking at the Authoring mix of the original BBOARD 
benchmark, there are no visible gains from Ganesh at 100 Mb/s. Ganesh,
however, still tracks Native in terms of throughput. While the 
average response time is higher for Ganesh, the absolute difference is
in between 0.01 and 0.04 seconds and would be imperceptible to
the end-user. The Browsing mix shows an even smaller difference
in average response times. The results from the filter variant of the
BBOARD benchmarks are similar. Even for the AUCTION 
benchmark, the difference between Native and Ganesh"s response time at
100 Mb/s was never greater than 0.02 seconds. The only exception
to the above results was seen in the filter variant of the BBOARD
benchmark where Ganesh at 1600 test clients added 0.85 seconds
to the average response time. Thus, even for much faster networks
where the WAN link is not the bottleneck, Ganesh always delivers
throughput equivalent to Native. While some extra latency is added
by the proxy-based design, it is usually imperceptible.
8. RELATED WORK
To the best of our knowledge, Ganesh is the first system that
combines the use of hash-based techniques with caching of database
results to improve throughput and response times for applications
with dynamic content. We also believe that it is also the first 
system to demonstrate the benefits of using structural information for

detecting similarity. In this section, we first discuss alternative 
approaches to caching dynamic content and then examine other uses
of hash-based primitives in distributed systems.
8.1 Caching Dynamic Content
At the database layer, a number of systems have advocated 
middletier caching where parts of the database are replicated at the edge or
server [3, 4, 20]. These systems either cache entire tables in what
is essentially a replicated database or use materialized views from
previous query replies [19]. They require tight integration with the
back-end database to ensure a time bound on the propagation of
updates. These systems are also usually targeted towards 
workloads that do not require strict consistency and can tolerate stale
data. Further, unlike Ganesh, some of these mid-tier caching 
solutions [2, 3], suffer from the complexity of having to participate in
query planing and distributed query processing.
Gao et al. [15] propose using a distributed object replication
architecture where the data store"s consistency requirements are
adapted on a per-application basis. These solutions require 
substantial developer resources and detailed understanding of the 
application being modified. While systems that attempt to automate
the partitioning and replication of an application"s database 
exist [34], they do not provide full transaction semantics. In 
comparison, Ganesh does not weaken any of the semantics provided by
the underlying database.
Recent work in the evaluation of edge caching options for 
dynamic web sites [38] has suggested that, without careful planning,
employing complex offloading strategies can hurt performance. 
Instead, the work advocates for an architecture in which all tiers 
except the database should be offloaded to the edge. Our evaluation of
Ganesh has shown that it would benefit these scenarios. To improve
database scalability, C-JDBC [10], SSS [22], and Ganymed [28]
also advocate the use of an interposition-based architecture to 
transparently cluster and replicate databases at the middleware level.
The approaches of these architectures and Ganesh are 
complementary and they would benefit each other.
Moving up to the presentation layer, there has been widespread
adoption of fragment-based caching [14], which improves cache
utilization by separately caching different parts of generated web
pages. While fragment-based caching works at the edge, a recent
proposal has proposed moving web page assembly to the clients to
optimize content delivery [31]. While Ganesh is not used at the 
presentation layer, the same principles have been applied in Duplicate
Transfer Detection [25] to increase web cache efficiency as well as
for web access across bandwidth limited links [33].
8.2 Hash-based Systems
The past few years have seen the emergence of many systems
that exploit hash-based techniques. At the heart of all these 
systems is the idea of detecting similarity in data without requiring 
interpretation of that data. This simple yet elegant idea relies on 
cryptographic hashing, as discussed earlier in Section 2. Successful 
applications of this idea span a wide range of storage systems. 
Examples include peer-to-peer backup of personal computing files [11],
storage-efficient archiving of data [29], and finding similar files [21].
Spring and Wetherall [35] apply similar principles at the network
level. Using synchronized caches at both ends of a network link,
duplicated data is replaced by smaller tokens for transmission and
then restored at the remote end. This and other hash-based systems
such as the CASPER [37] and LBFS [26] filesystems, and Layer-2
bandwidth optimizers such as Riverbed and Peribit use Rabin 
fingerprinting [30] to discover spans of commonality in data. This 
approach is especially useful when data items are modified in-place
through insertions, deletions, and updates. However, as Section 6
shows, the performance of this technique can show a dramatic drop
in the presence of data reordering. Ganesh instead uses row 
boundaries as dividers for detecting similarity.
The most aggressive use of hash-based techniques is by systems
that use hashes as the primary identifiers for objects in persistent
storage. Storage systems such as CFS [12] and PAST [13] that
have been built using distributed hash tables fall into this category.
Single Instance Storage [6] and Venti [29] are other examples of
such systems. As discussed in Section 2.2, the use of cryptographic
hashes for addressing persistent data represents a deeper level of
faith in their collision-resistance than that assumed by Ganesh. If
time reveals shortcomings in the hash algorithm, the effort involved
in correcting the flaw is much greater. In Ganesh, it is merely a
matter of replacing the hash algorithm.
9. CONCLUSION
The growing use of dynamic web content generated from 
relational databases places increased demands on WAN bandwidth.
Traditional caching solutions for bandwidth and latency reduction
are often ineffective for such content. This paper shows that the
impact of WAN accesses to databases can be substantially reduced
through the Ganesh architecture without any compromise of the
database"s strict consistency semantics. The essence of the Ganesh
architecture is the use of computation at the edges to reduce 
communication through the Internet. Ganesh is able to use 
cryptographic hashes to detect similarity with previous results and send
WWW 2007 / Track: Performance and Scalability Session: Scalable Systems for Dynamic Content
319
compact recipes of results rather than full results. Our design uses
interposition to achieve complete transparency: clients, application
servers, and database servers are all unaware of Ganesh"s presence
and require no modification.
Our experimental evaluation confirms that Ganesh, while 
conceptually simple, can be highly effective in improving throughput
and response time. Our results also confirm that exploiting the
structure present in database results to detect similarity is crucial
to this performance improvement.
