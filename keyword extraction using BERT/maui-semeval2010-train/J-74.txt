ABSTRACT
Motivated by the rise of online auctions and their relative
lack of security, this paper analyzes two forms of cheating in
sealed-bid auctions. The first type of cheating we consider
occurs when the seller spies on the bids of a second-price
auction and then inserts a fake bid in order to increase the
payment of the winning bidder. In the second type, a bidder
cheats in a first-price auction by examining the competing
bids before deciding on his own bid. In both cases, we derive
equilibrium strategies when bidders are aware of the 
possibility of cheating. These results provide insights into 
sealedbid auctions even in the absence of cheating, including some
counterintuitive results on the effects of overbidding in a
first-price auction.

1. INTRODUCTION
Among the types of auctions commonly used in practice,
sealed-bid auctions are a good practical choice because they
require little communication and can be completed almost
instantly. Each bidder simply submits a bid, and the winner
is immediately determined. However, sealed-bid auctions
do require that the bids be kept private until the auction
clears. The increasing popularity of online auctions only
makes this disadvantage more troublesome. At an auction
house, with all participants present, it is difficult to examine
a bid that another bidder gave directly to the auctioneer.
However, in an online auction the auctioneer is often little
more than a server with questionable security; and, since all
participants are in different locations, one can anonymously
attempt to break into the server. In this paper, we present a
game theoretic analysis of how bidders should behave when
they are aware of the possibility of cheating that is based on
knowledge of the bids.
We investigate this type of cheating along two dimensions:
whether it is the auctioneer or a bidder who cheats, and
which variant (either first or second-price) of the sealed-bid
auction is used. Note that two of these cases are trivial.
In our setting, there is no incentive for the seller to submit
a shill bid in a first price auction, because doing so would
either cancel the auction or not affect the payment of the
winning bidder. In a second-price auction, knowing the 
competing bids does not help a bidder because it is dominant
strategy to bid truthfully. This leaves us with two cases that
we examine in detail.
A seller can profitably cheat in a second-price auction by
looking at the bids before the auction clears and submitting
an extra bid. This possibility was pointed out as early as
the seminal paper [12] that introduced this type of auction.
For example, if the bidders in an eBay auction each use a
proxy bidder (essentially creating a second-price auction),
then the seller may be able to break into eBay"s server, 
observe the maximum price that a bidder is willing to pay, and
then extract this price by submitting a shill bid just below
it using a false identity. We assume that there is no chance
that the seller will be caught when it cheats. However, not
all sellers are willing to use this power (or, not all sellers can
successfully cheat). We assume that each bidder knows the
probability with which the seller will cheat. Possible 
motivation for this knowledge could be a recently published expos´e
on seller cheating in eBay auctions. In this setting, we derive
an equilibrium bidding strategy for the case in which each
bidder"s value for the good is independently drawn from a
common distribution (with no further assumptions except
for continuity and differentiability). This result shows how
first and second-price auctions can be viewed as the 
endpoints of a spectrum of auctions.
But why should the seller have all the fun? In a first-price
auction, a bidder must bid below his value for the good (also
called shaving his bid) in order to have positive utility if he
76
wins. To decide how much to shave his bid, he must trade off
the probability of winning the auction against how much he
will pay if he does win. Of course, if he could simply examine
the other bids before submitting his own, then his problem
is solved: bid the minimum necessary to win the auction.
In this setting, our goal is to derive an equilibrium bidding
strategy for a non-cheating bidder who is aware of the 
possibility that he is competing against cheating bidders. When
bidder values are drawn from the commonly-analyzed 
uniform distribution, we show the counterintuitive result that
the possibility of other bidders cheating has no effect on
the equilibrium strategy of an honest bidder. This result
is then extended to show the robustness of the equilibrium
of a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating.
We conclude this section by exploring other distributions,
including some in which the presence of cheating bidders
actually induces an honest bidder to lower its bid.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section
2 we formalize the setting and present our results for the
case of a seller cheating in a second price auction. Section
3 covers the case of bidders cheating in a first-price auction.
In Section 4, we quantify the effects that the possibility of
cheating has on an honest seller in the two settings. We
discuss related work, including other forms of cheating in
auctions, in Section 5, before concluding with Section 6. All
proofs and derivations are found in the appendix.
2. SECOND-PRICE AUCTION,
CHEATING SELLER
In this section, we consider a second-price auction in which
the seller may cheat by inserting a shill bid after 
observing all of the bids. The formulation for this section will be
largely reused in the following section on bidders cheating
in a first-price auction. While no prior knowledge of game
theory or auction theory is assumed, good introductions can
be found in [2] and [6], respectively.
2.1 Formulation
The setting consists of N bidders, or agents, (indexed by
i = 1, · · · , n) and a seller. Each agent has a type θi ∈
[0, 1], drawn from a continuous range, which represents the
agent"s value for the good being auctioned.2
Each agent"s
type is independently drawn from a cumulative distribution
function (cdf ) F over [0, 1], where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1.
We assume that F(·) is strictly increasing and differentiable
over the interval [0, 1]. Call the probability density function
(pdf ) f(θi) = F (θi), which is the derivative of the cdf.
Each agent knows its own type θi, but only the 
distribution over the possible types of the other agents. A bidding
strategy for an agent bi : [0, 1] → [0, 1] maps its type to its
bid.3
Let θ = (θ1, · · · , θn) be the vector of types for all agents,
and θ−i = (θ1, · · · , θi−1, θi+1, · · · θn) be the vector of all
types except for that of agent i. We can then combine the
vectors so that θ = (θi, θ−i). We also define the vector of
bids as b(θ) = (b1(θ1), . . . , bn(θn)), and this vector without
2
We can restrict the types to the range [0, 1] without loss
of generality because any distribution over a different range
can be normalized to this range.
3
We thus limit agents to deterministic bidding strategies,
but, because of our continuity assumption, there always 
exists a pure strategy equilibrium.
the bid of agent i as b−i(θ−i). Let b[1](θ) be the value of the
highest bid of the vector b(θ), with a corresponding 
definition for b[1](θ−i).
An agent obviously wins the auction if its bid is greater
than all other bids, but ties complicate the formulation. 
Fortunately, we can ignore the case of ties in this paper because
our continuity assumption will make them a zero probability
event in equilibrium. We assume that the seller does not set
a reserve price.4
If the seller does not cheat, then the winning agent pays
the highest bid by another agent. On the other hand, if
the seller does cheat, then the winning agent will pay its
bid, since we assume that a cheating seller would take full
advantage of its power. Let the indicator variable µc
be 1
if the seller cheats, and 0 otherwise. The probability that
the seller cheats, Pc
, is known by all agents.5
We can then
write the payment of the winning agent as follows.
pi(b(θ), µc
) = µc
· bi(θi) − (1 − µc
) · b[1](θ−i) (1)
Let µ(·) be an indicator function that takes an inequality
as an argument and returns is 1 if it holds, and 0 otherwise.
The utility for agent i is zero if it does not win the auction,
and the difference between its valuation and its price if it
does.
ui(b(θ), µc
, θi) = µ bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) · θi − pi(b(θ), µc
)
(2)
We will be concerned with the expected utility of an agent,
with the expectation taken over the types of the other agents
and over whether or not the seller cheats. By pushing the
expectation inward so that it is only over the price 
(conditioned on the agent winning the auction), we can write the
expected utility as:
Eθ−i,µc [ui(b(θ), µc
, θi)] = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) ·
θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (3)
We assume that all agents are rational, expected utility
maximizers. Because of the uncertainty over the types of
the other agents, we will be looking for a Bayes-Nash 
equilibrium. A vector of bidding strategies b∗
is a Bayes-Nash
equilibrium if for each agent i and each possible type θi,
agent i cannot increase its expected utility by using an 
alternate bidding strategy bi, holding the bidding strategies
for all other agents fixed. Formally, b∗
is a Bayes-Nash 
equilibrium if:
∀i, θi, bi Eθ−i,µc ui b∗
i (θi), b∗
−i(θ−i) , µc
, θi ≥
Eθ−i,µc ui bi(θi), b∗
−i(θ−i) , µc
, θi (4)
2.2 Equilibrium
We first present the Bayes-Nash equilibrium for an 
arbitrary distribution F(·).
4
This simplifies the analysis, but all of our results can be
applied to the case in which the seller announces a reserve
price before the auction begins.
5
Note that common knowledge is not necessary for the 
existence of an equilibrium.
77
Theorem 1. In a second-price auction in which the seller
cheats with probability Pc
, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for
each agent to bid according to the following strategy:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
F( N−1
P c )
(θi)
(5)
It is useful to consider the extreme points of Pc
. Setting
Pc
= 1 yields the correct result for a first-price auction (see,
e.g., [10]). In the case of Pc
= 0, this solution is not defined.
However, in the limit, bi(θi) approaches θi as Pc
approaches
0, which is what we expect as the auction approaches a
standard second-price auction.
The position of Pc
is perhaps surprising. For example, the
linear combination bi(θi) = θi − Pc
·
θi
0 F (N−1)
(x)dx
F (N−1)(θi)
of the
equilibrium bidding strategies of first and second-price 
auctions would have also given us the correct bidding strategies
for the cases of Pc
= 0 and Pc
= 1.
2.3 Continuum of Auctions
An alternative perspective on the setting is as a 
continuum between first and second-price auctions. Consider a
probabilistic sealed-bid auction in which the seller is 
honest, but the price paid by the winning agent is determined
by a weighted coin flip: with probability Pc
it is his bid,
and with probability 1 − Pc
it is the second-highest bid.
By adjusting Pc
, we can smoothly move between a first
and second-price auction. Furthermore, the fact that this
probabilistic auction satisfies the properties required for the
Revenue Equivalence Theorem (see, e.g., [2]) provides a way
to verify that the bidding strategy in Equation 5 is the 
symmetric equilibrium of this auction (see the alternative proof
of Theorem 1 in the appendix).
2.4 Special Case: Uniform Distribution
Another way to try to gain insight into Equation 5 is by
instantiating the distribution of types. We now consider the
often-studied uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.
Corollary 2. In a second-price auction in which the
seller cheats with probability Pc
, and F(θi) = θi, it is a
Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to
the following strategy:
bi(θi) =
N − 1
N − 1 + Pc
θi (6)
This equilibrium bidding strategy, parameterized by Pc
,
can be viewed as an interpolation between two well-known
results. When Pc
= 0 the bidding strategy is now 
welldefined (each agent bids its true type), while when Pc
= 1
we get the correct result for a first-price auction: each agent
bids according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
3. FIRST-PRICE AUCTION,
CHEATING AGENTS
We now consider the case in which the seller is honest,
but there is a chance that agents will cheat and examine the
other bids before submitting their own (or, alternatively,
they will revise their bid before the auction clears). Since
this type of cheating is pointless in a second-price auction,
we only analyze the case of a first-price auction. After 
revising the formulation from the previous section, we present a
fixed point equation for the equilibrium strategy for an 
arbitrary distribution F(·). This equation will be useful for the
analysis the uniform distribution, in which we show that the
possibility of cheating agents does not change the 
equilibrium strategy of honest agents. This result has implications
for the robustness of the symmetric equilibrium to 
overbidding in a standard first-price auction. Furthermore, we find
that for other distributions overbidding actually induces a
competing agent to shave more off of its bid.
3.1 Formulation
It is clear that if a single agent is cheating, he will bid
(up to his valuation) the minimum amount necessary to win
the auction. It is less obvious, though, what will happen if
multiple agents cheat. One could imagine a scenario similar
to an English auction, in which all cheating agents keep
revising their bids until all but one cheater wants the good
at the current winning bid. However, we are only concerned
with how an honest agent should bid given that it is aware
of the possibility of cheating. Thus, it suffices for an honest
agent to know that it will win the auction if and only if
its bid exceeds every other honest agent"s bid and every
cheating agent"s type.
This intuition can be formalized as the following 
discriminatory auction. In the first stage, each agent"s payment
rule is determined. With probability Pa
, the agent will pay
the second highest bid if it wins the auction (essentially,
he is a cheater), and otherwise it will have to pay its bid.
These selections are recorded by a vector of indicator 
variables µa
= (µa1
, . . . , µan
), where µai
= 1 denotes that agent
i pays the second highest bid. Each agent knows the 
probability Pa
, but does not know the payment rule for all other
agents. Otherwise, this auction is a standard, sealed-bid
auction. It is thus a dominant strategy for a cheater to bid
its true type, making this formulation strategically 
equivalent to the setting outlined in the previous paragraph. The
expression for the utility of an honest agent in this 
discriminatory auction is as follows.
ui(b(θ), µa
, θi) = θi − bi(θ) ·
j=i
µaj
· µ bi(θi) > θj + (1 − µaj
) · µ bi(θi) > bj(θj)
(7)
3.2 Equilibrium
Our goal is to find the equilibrium in which all cheating
agents use their dominant strategy of bidding truthfully and
honest agents bid according to a symmetric bidding strategy.
Since we have left F(·) unspecified, we cannot present a
closed form solution for the honest agent"s bidding strategy,
and instead give a fixed point equation for it.
Theorem 3. In a first-price auction in which each agent
cheats with probability Pa
, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium
for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy
that is a fixed point of the following equation:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x)
(N−1)
dx
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi)
(N−1)
(8)
78
3.3 Special Case: Uniform Distribution
Since we could not solve Equation 8 in the general case,
we can only see how the possibility of cheating affects the
equilibrium bidding strategy for particular instances of F(·).
A natural place to start is uniform distribution: F(θi) = θi.
Recall the logic behind the symmetric equilibrium strategy
in a first-price auction without cheating: bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi is
the optimal tradeoff between increasing the probability of
winning and decreasing the price paid upon winning, given
that the other agents are bidding according to the same
strategy. Since in the current setting the cheating agents
do not shave their bid at all and thus decrease an honest
agent"s probability of winning (while obviously not affecting
the price that an honest agent pays if he wins), it is 
natural to expect that an honest agent should compensate by
increasing his bid. The idea is that sacrificing some 
potential profit in order to regain some of the lost probability of
winning would bring the two sides of the tradeoff back into
balance. However, it turns out that the equilibrium bidding
strategy is unchanged.
Corollary 4. In a first-price auction in which each agent
cheats with probability Pa
, and F(θi) = θi, it is a 
BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid 
according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
This result suggests that the equilibrium of a first-price
auction is particularly robust when types are drawn from the
uniform distribution, since the best response is unaffected
by deviations of the other agents to the strategy of always
bidding their type. In fact, as long as all other agents shave
their bid by a fraction (which can differ across the agents) no
greater than 1
N
, it is still a best response for the remaining
agent to bid according to the equilibrium strategy. Note
that this result holds even if other agents are shaving their
bid by a negative fraction, and are thus irrationally bidding
above their type.
Theorem 5. In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if
each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) =
N−1+αj
N
θj,
where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining
agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
Obviously, these strategy profiles are not equilibria (unless
each αj = 0), because each agent j has an incentive to set
αj = 0. The point of this theorem is that a wide range of
possible beliefs that an agent can hold about the strategies
of the other agents will all lead him to play the equilibrium
strategy. This is important because a common (and valid)
criticism of equilibrium concepts such as Nash and 
BayesNash is that they are silent on how the agents converge
on a strategy profile from which no one wants to deviate.
However, if the equilibrium strategy is a best response to a
large set of strategy profiles that are out of equilibrium, then
it seems much more plausible that the agents will indeed
converge on this equilibrium.
It is important to note, though, that while this equilibrium
is robust against arbitrary deviations to strategies that shave
less, it is not robust to even a single agent shaving more off
of its bid. In fact, if we take any strategy profile consistent
with the conditions of Theorem 5 and change a single agent
j"s strategy so that its corresponding αj is negative, then
agent i"s best response is to shave more than 1
N
off of its
bid.
3.4 Effects of Overbidding for
Other Distributions
A natural question is whether the best response bidding
strategy is similarly robust to overbidding by competing
agents for other distributions. It turns out that Theorem
5 holds for all distributions of the form F(θi) = (θi)k
, where
k is some positive integer. However, taking a simple linear
combination of two such distributions to produce F(θi) =
θ2
i +θi
2
yields a distribution in which an agent should 
actually shave its bid more when other agents shave their bids
less. In the example we present for this distribution (with
the details in the appendix), there are only two players and
the deviation by one agent is to bid his type. However, it
can be generalized to a higher number of agents and to other
deviations.
Example 1. In a first-price auction where F(θi) =
θ2
i +θi
2
and N = 2, if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2),
then, for all θ1 > 0, agent 1"s best response bidding strategy
is strictly less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric
equilibrium.
We also note that the same result holds for the normalized
exponential distribution (F(θi) = eθi −1
e−1
).
It is certainly the case that distributions can be found
that support the intuition given above that agents should
shave their bid less when other agents are doing likewise.
Examples include F(θi) = −1
2
θ2
i + 3
2
θi (the solution to the
system of equations: F (θi) = −1, F(0) = 0, and F(1) = 1),
and F(θi) = e−e(1−θi)
e−1
.
It would be useful to relate the direction of the change
in the best response bidding strategy to a general 
condition on F(·). Unfortunately, we were not able to find such
a condition, in part because the integral in the symmetric
bidding strategy of a first-price auction cannot be solved
without knowing F(·) (or at least some restrictions on it).
We do note, however, that the sign of the second 
derivative of F(θi)/f(θi) is an accurate predictor for all of the
distributions that we considered.
4. REVENUE LOSS FOR AN
HONEST SELLER
In both of the settings we covered, an honest seller suffers
a loss in expected revenue due to the possibility of cheating.
The equilibrium bidding strategies that we derived allow us
to quantify this loss. Although this is as far as we will take
the analysis, it could be applied to more general settings,
in which the seller could, for example, choose the market
in which he sells his good or pay a trusted third party to
oversee the auction.
In a second-price auction in which the seller may cheat, an
honest seller suffers due the fact that the agents will shave
their bids. For the case in which agent types are drawn from
the uniform distribution, every agent will shave its bid by
P c
N−1+P c , which is thus also the fraction by which an honest
seller"s revenue decreases due to the possibility of cheating.
Analysis of the case of a first-price auction in which agents
may cheat is not so straightforward. If Pa
= 1 (each agent
cheats with certainty), then we simply have a second-price
auction, and the seller"s expected revenue will be unchanged.
Again considering the uniform distribution for agent types,
it is not surprising that Pa
= 1
2
causes the seller to lose
79
the most revenue. However, even in this worst case, the
percentage of expected revenue lost is significantly less than
it is for the second-price auction in which Pc
= 1
2
, as shown
in Table 1.6
It turns out that setting Pc
= 0.2 would make
the expected loss of these two settings comparable. While
this comparison between the settings is unlikely to be useful
for a seller, it is interesting to note that agent suspicions of
possible cheating by the seller are in some sense worse than
agents actually cheating themselves.

valuations are drawn from the uniform distribution.
5. RELATED WORK
Existing work covers another dimension along which we
could analyze cheating: altering the perceived value of N.
In this paper, we have assumed that N is known by all
of the bidders. However, in an online setting this 
assumption is rather tenuous. For example, a bidder"s only source
of information about N could be a counter that the seller
places on the auction webpage, or a statement by the seller
about the number of potential bidders who have indicated
that they will participate. In these cases, the seller could
arbitrarily manipulate the perceived N. In a first-price 
auction, the seller obviously has an incentive to increase the
perceived value of N in order to induce agents to bid closer
to their true valuation. However, if agents are aware that
the seller has this power, then any communication about
N to the agents is cheap talk, and furthermore is not
credible. Thus, in equilibrium the agents would ignore the
declared value of N, and bid according to their own prior
beliefs about the number of agents. If we make the natural
assumption of a common prior, then the setting reduces to
the one tackled by [5], which derived the equilibrium 
bidding strategies of a first-price auction when the number of
bidders is drawn from a known distribution but not revealed
to any of the bidders. Of course, instead of assuming that
the seller can always exploit this power, we could assume
that it can only do so with some probability that is known
by the agents. The analysis would then proceed in a similar
manner as that of our cheating seller model.
The other interesting case of this form of cheating is by
bidders in a first-price auction. Bidders would obviously
want to decrease the perceived number of agents in order
to induce their competition to lower their bids. While it is
6
Note that we have not considered the costs of the seller.
Thus, the expected loss in profit could be much greater than
the numbers that appear here.
unreasonable for bidders to be able to alter the perceived
N arbitrarily, collusion provides an opportunity to decrease
the perceived N by having only one of a group of colluding
agents participate in the auction. While the non-colluding
agents would account for this possibility, as long as they are
not certain of the collusion they will still be induced to shave
more off of their bids than they would if the collusion did
not take place. This issue is tackled in [7].
Other types of collusion are of course related to the 
general topic of cheating in auctions. Results on collusion in
first and second-price auctions can be found in [8] and [3],
respectively.
The work most closely related to our first setting is [11],
which also presents a model in which the seller may cheat in
a second-price auction. In their setting, the seller is a 
participant in the Bayesian game who decides between running
a first-price auction (where profitable cheating is never 
possible) or second-price auction. The seller makes this choice
after observing his type, which is his probability of having
the opportunity and willingness to cheat in a second-price
auction. The bidders, who know the distribution from which
the seller"s type is drawn, then place their bid. It is shown
that, in equilibrium, only a seller with the maximum 
probability of cheating would ever choose to run a second-price
auction. Our work differs in that we focus on the agents"
strategies in a second-price auction for a given probability
of cheating by the seller. An explicit derivation of the 
equilibrium strategies then allows us relate first and second-price
auctions.
An area of related work that can be seen as 
complementary to ours is that of secure auctions, which takes the point
of view of an auction designer. The goals often extend
well beyond simply preventing cheating, including 
properties such as anonymity of the bidders and nonrepudiation of
bids. Cryptographic methods are the standard weapon of
choice here (see [1, 4, 9]).
6. CONCLUSION
In this paper we presented the equilibria of sealed-bid 
auctions in which cheating is possible. In addition to providing
strategy profiles that are stable against deviations, these 
results give us with insights into both first and second-price
auctions. The results for the case of a cheating seller in a
second-price auction allow us to relate the two auctions as
endpoints along a continuum. The case of agents cheating in
a first-price auction showed the robustness of the first-price
auction equilibrium when agent types are drawn from the
uniform distribution. We also explored the effect of 
overbidding on the best response bidding strategy for other 
distributions, and showed that even for relatively simple 
distributions it can be positive, negative, or neutral. Finally,
results from both of our settings allowed us to quantify the
expected loss in revenue for a seller due to the possibility of
cheating.

APPENDIX
Theorem 1. In a second-price auction in which the seller
cheats with probability Pc
, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium for
each agent to bid according to the following strategy:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
F( N−1
P c )
(θi)
(5)
Proof. To find an equilibrium, we start by guessing that
there exists an equilibrium in which all agents bid 
according to the same function bi(θi), because the game is 
symmetric. Further, we guess that bi(θi) is strictly increasing
and differentiable over the range [0, 1]. We can also assume
that bi(0) = 0, because negative bids are not allowed and
a positive bid is not rational when the agent"s valuation is
0. Note that these are not assumptions on the setting- they
are merely limitations that we impose on our search.
Let Φi : [0, bi(1)] → [0, 1] be the inverse function of bi(θi).
That is, it takes a bid for agent i as input and returns the
type θi that induced this bid. Recall Equation 3:
Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc
, θi) = Prob bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) ·
θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i)
The probability that a single other bid is below that of
agent i is equal to the cdf at the type that would induce
a bid equal to that of agent i, which is formally written as
F(Φi(bi(θi))). Since all agents are independent, the 
probability that all other bids are below agent i"s is simply this
term raised the (N − 1)-th power.
Thus, we can re-write the expected utility as:
Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc
, θi) = FN−1
(Φi(bi(θi)))·
θi − Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) (9)
We now solve for the expected payment. Plugging 
Equation 1 (which gives the price for the winning agent) into the
term for the expected price in Equation 9, and then 
simplifying the expectation yields:
Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i)
= Eθ−i,µc µc
· bi(θi) + (1 − µc
) · b[1](θ−i) |
bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i)
= Pc
· bi(θi) + (1 − Pc
) · Eθ−i b[1](θ−i) |
bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i)
= Pc
· bi(θi) + (1 − Pc
) ·
bi(θi)
0
b[1](θ−i)·
pdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) db[1](θ−i) (10)
Note that the integral on the last line is taken up to
bi(θi) because we are conditioning on the fact that bi(θi) >
b[1](θ−i). To derive the pdf of b[1](θ−i) given this condition,
we start with the cdf. For a given value b[1](θ−i), the 
probability that any one agent"s bid is less than this value is equal
to F(Φi(b[1](θ−i))). We then condition on the agent"s bid
being below bi(θi) by dividing by F(Φi(bi(θi))). The cdf for
the N − 1 agents is then this value raised to the (N − 1)-th
power.
cdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) =
FN−1
(Φi(b[1](θ−i)))
FN−1(Φi(bi(θi)))
The pdf is then the derivative of the cdf with respect to
b[1](θ−i):
pdf b[1](θ−i) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i)
=
N − 1
FN−1(Φi(bi(θi)))
· FN−2
(Φi(b[1](θ−i)))·
f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i))
Substituting the pdf into Equation 10 and pulling terms
out of the integral that do not depend on b[1](θ−i) yields:
Eθ−i,µc pi(b(θ), µc
) | bi(θi) > b[1](θ−i) = Pc
· bi(θi)+

) · (N − 1)

(Φi(b[1](θ−i)))·
f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i)) db[1](θ−i)
81
Plugging the expected price back into the expected utility
equation (9), and distributing FN−1
(Φi(bi(θi))), yields:
Eθ−i,µc ui(b(θ), µc
, θi) = FN−1
(Φi(bi(θi))) · θi−

b[1](θ−i) · FN−2
(Φi(b[1](θ−i)))·
f(Φi(b[1](θ−i))) · Φi(b[1](θ−i)) db[1](θ−i)
We are now ready to optimize the expected utility by 
taking the derivative with respect to bi(θi) and setting it to 0.
Note that we do not need to solve the integral, because it
will disappear when the derivative is taken (by application
of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus).
0 = (N−1)·FN−2

(Φi(bi(θi)))·f(Φi(bi(θi)))·Φi(bi(θi))
Dividing through by FN−2
(Φi(bi(θi))) and combining like
terms yields:
0 = θi − Pc
· bi(θi) − (1 − Pc
) · bi(θi) · (N − 1)
· f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) − Pc
· F(Φi(bi(θi)))
Simplifying the expression and rearranging terms produces:
bi(θi) = θi −
Pc
· F(Φi(bi(θi)))
(N − 1) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi))
To further simplify, we use the formula f (x) = 1
g (f(x))
,
where g(x) is the inverse function of f(x). Plugging in 
function from our setting gives us: Φi(bi(θi)) = 1
bi(θi)
. Applying
both this equation and Φi(bi(θi)) = θi yields:
bi(θi) = θi −
Pc
· F(θi) · bi(θi)
(N − 1) · f(θi)
(11)
Attempts at a derivation of the solution from this point
proved fruitless, but we are at a point now where a guessed
solution can be quickly verified. We used the solution for
the first-price auction (see, e.g., [10]) as our starting point
to find the answer:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
F( N−1

(12)
To verify the solution, we first take its derivative:
bi(θi) = 1−
F(2· N−1

(θi) − N−1
P c · F( N−1
P c −1)
(θi) · f(θi) ·
θi

This simplifies to:
bi(θi) =
N−1
P c · f(θi) ·
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
F( N−1
P c +1)
(θi)
We then plug this derivative into the equation we derived
(11):
bi(θi) = θi −
Pc
· F(θi) · N−1
P c · f(θi) ·
θi
0
F( N−1
P c )
(x)dx
(N − 1) · f(θi) · F( N−1
P c +1)
(θi)
Cancelling terms yields Equation 12, verifying that our
guessed solution is correct.
Alternative Proof of Theorem 1:
The following proof uses the Revenue Equivalence 
Theorem (RET) and the probabilistic auction given as an 
interpretation of our cheating seller setting.
In a first-price auction without the possibility of cheating,
the expected payment for an agent with type θi is simply
the product of its bid and the probability that this bid is
the highest. For the symmetric equilibrium, this is equal to:
F(N−1)
(θi) · θi −
θi
0
F(N−1)
(x)dx
F(N−1)(θi)
For our probabilistic auction, the expected payment of
the winning agent is a weighted average of its bid and the
second highest bid. For the bi(·) we found in the original
interpretation of the setting, it can be written as follows.
F(N−1)
(θi) · Pc
θi −

0
F( N−1

(x)·f(x)dx
By the RET, the expected payments will be the same
in the two auctions. Thus, we can verify our equilibrium
bidding strategy by showing that the expected payment in
the two auctions is equal. Since the expected payment is
zero at θi = 0 for both functions, it suffices to verify that the
derivatives of the expected payment functions with respect
to θi are equal, for an arbitrary value θi. Thus, we need to
verify the following equation:
F(N−1)
(θi) + (N − 1) · F(N−2)
(θi) · f(θi) · θi − F(N−1)
(θi)

After distributing Pc
, the right-hand side of this equation
cancels out, and we have verified our equilibrium bidding
strategy.
Corollary 2. In a second-price auction in which the
seller cheats with probability Pc
, and F(θi) = θi, it is a
Bayes-Nash equilibrium for each agent to bid according to
the following strategy:
bi(θi) =
N − 1
N − 1 + Pc

Proof. Plugging F(θi) = θi into Equation 5 (repeated
as 12), we get:

Theorem 3. In a first-price auction in which each agent
cheats with probability Pa
, it is a Bayes-Nash equilibrium
for each non-cheating agent i to bid according to the strategy
that is a fixed point of the following equation:
bi(θi) = θi −
θi
0 Pa · F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa) · F(x)
(N−1)
dx
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi)
(N−1)
(8)
Proof. We make the same guesses about the equilibrium
strategy to aid our search as we did in the proof of Theorem
1. When simplifying the expectation of this setting"s 
utility equation (7), we use the fact that the probability that
agent i will have a higher bid than another honest agent is
still F(Φi(bi(θi))), while the probability is F(bi(θi)) if the
other agent cheats. The probability that agent i beats a
single other agent is then a weighted average of these two
probabilities. Thus, we can write agent i"s expected utility
as:
Eθ−i,µa ui(b(θ), µa
, θi) = θi − bi(θi) ·
Pa
· F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(Φi(bi(θi)))
N−1
As before, to find the equilibrium bi(θi), we take the
derivative and set it to zero:
0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)·
Pa
· F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(Φi(bi(θi)))
N−2
·
Pa
· f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · f(Φi(bi(θi))) · Φi(bi(θi)) −
Pa
· F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(Φi(bi(θi)))
N−1
Applying the equations Φi(bi(θi)) = 1
bi(θi)
and Φi(bi(θi)) =
θi, and dividing through, produces:
0 = θi − bi(θi) · (N − 1)·
Pa
· f(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · f(θi) ·
1
bi(θi)
−
Pa
· F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(θi)
Rearranging terms yields:
bi(θi) = θi −
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi) · bi(θi)
(N − 1) · Pa · f(bi(θi)) · bi(θi) + (1 − Pa) · f(θi)
(13)
In this setting, because we leave F(·) unspecified, we 
cannot present a closed form solution. However, we can simplify
the expression by removing its dependence on bi(θi).
bi(θi) = θi −

(N−1)
dx
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi)

(14)
To verify Equation 14, first take its derivative:
bi(θi) = 1 − 1−
(N − 1) · Pa
· F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(θi)
(N−2)
·

· F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa
) · F(x)
(N−1)
dx
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi)
2(N−1)
This equation simplifies to:
bi(θi) = (N −1)· Pa
·f(bi(θi))·bi(θi))+(1−Pa
)·f(θi) ·
θi
0
Pa
· F(bi(x)) + (1 − Pa

(N−1)
dx
Pa · F(bi(θi)) + (1 − Pa) · F(θi)

Plugging this equation into the bi(θi) in the numerator of
Equation 13 yields Equation 14, verifying the solution.

Corollary 4. In a first-price auction in which each agent
cheats with probability Pa
, and F(θi) = θi, it is a 
BayesNash equilibrium for each non-cheating agent to bid 
according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1

Theorem 5. In a first-price auction where F(θi) = θi, if
each agent j = i bids according a strategy bj(θj) =
N−1+αj
N
θj,
where αj ≥ 0, then it is a best response for the remaining
agent i to bid according to the strategy bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
Proof. We again use Φj : [0, bj(1)] → [0, 1] as the inverse
of bj(θj). For all j = i in this setting, Φj(x) = N
N−1+αj
x.
The probability that agent i has a higher bid than a single
agent j is F(Φj(bi(θi))) = N
N−1+αj
bi(θi). Note, however,
that since Φj(·) is only defined over the range [0, bj(1)], it
must be the case that bi(1) ≤ bj(1), which is why αj ≥
0 is necessary, in addition to being sufficient. Assuming
that bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi, then indeed Φj(bi(θi)) is always 
welldefined. We will now show that this assumption is correct.
The expected utility for agent i can then be written as:
Eθ−i ui(b(θ), θi) = Πj=i
N
N − 1 + αj
bi(θi) · θi −bi(θ)
= Πj=i
N
N − 1 + αj
· θi· bi(θi)
(N−1)
− bi(θi)
N
Taking the derivative with respect to bi(θi), setting it to
zero, and dividing out Πj=i
N
N−1+αj
yields:
0 = θi · (N − 1) · bi(θi)
(N−2)
− N · bi(θi)
(N−1)
This simplifies to the solution: bi(θi) = N−1
N
θi.
Full Version of Example 1:
In a first-price auction where F(θi) =
θ2
i +θi
2
and N = 2,
if agent 2 always bids its type (b2(θ2) = θ2), then, for all
θ1 > 0, agent 1"s best response bidding strategy is strictly
less than the bidding strategy of the symmetric equilibrium.
After calculating the symmetric equilibrium in which both
agents shave their bid by the same amount, we find the best
response to an agent who instead does not shave its bid.
We then show that this best response is strictly less than
the equilibrium strategy. To find the symmetric equilibrium
bidding strategy, we instantiate N = 2 in the general 
formula the equation found in [10], plug in F(θi) =
θ2
i +θi

simplify:

We now derive the best response for agent 1 to the 
strategy b2(θ2) = θ2, denoting the best response strategy b∗
1(θ1)
to distinguish it from the symmetric case. The 
probability of agent 1 winning is F(b∗
1(θ1)), which is the probability
that agent 2"s type is less than agent 1"s bid. Thus, agent
1"s expected utility is:
Eθ2 ui((b∗
1(θ1), b2(θ2)), θ1) = F(b∗
1(θ1)) · θ1 − b∗
1(θ1)
=
(b∗

+ b∗
1(θ1)

· θ1 − b∗

Taking the derivative with respect to b∗
1(θ1), setting it to

Of the two solutions of this equation, one always produces
a negative bid. The other is:
b∗
1(θ1) =
θ1 − 1 + θ2
1 + θ1 + 1

We now need to show that b1(θ1) > b∗
1(θ1) holds for all

the inequality gives us:
