ABSTRACT
The Slammer, which is currently the fastest computer worm
in recorded history, was observed to infect 90 percent of all
vulnerable Internets hosts within 10 minutes. Although the
main action that the Slammer worm takes is a relatively 
unsophisticated replication of itself, it still spreads so quickly
that human response was ineffective. Most proposed 
countermeasures strategies are based primarily on rate detection
and limiting algorithms. However, such strategies are being
designed and developed to effectively contain worms whose
behaviors are similar to that of Slammer.
In our work, we put forth the hypothesis that next 
generation worms will be radically different, and potentially
such techniques will prove ineffective. Specifically, we 
propose to study a new generation of worms called Swarm
Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the concept of
emergent intelligence. Emergent Intelligence is the 
behavior of systems, very much like biological systems such as
ants or bees, where simple local interactions of autonomous
members, with simple primitive actions, gives rise to 
complex and intelligent global behavior. In this manuscript we
will introduce the basic principles behind the idea of Swarm
Worms, as well as the basic structure required in order to
be considered a swarm worm. In addition, we will present
preliminary results on the propagation speeds of one such
swarm worm, called the ZachiK worm. We will show that
ZachiK is capable of propagating at a rate 2 orders of 
magnitude faster than similar worms without swarm capabilities.

1. INTRODUCTION AND PREVIOUSWORK
In the early morning hours (05:30 GMT) of January 25,
2003 the fastest computer worm in recorded history began
spreading throughout the Internet. Within 10 minutes after
the first infected host (patient zero), 90 percent of all 
vulnerable hosts had been compromised creating significant 
disruption to the global Internet infrastructure. Vern Paxson of
the International Computer Science Institute and Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory in its analysis of Slammer
commented: The Slammer worm spread so quickly that 
human response was ineffective, see [4] The interesting part,
from our perspective, about the spread of Slammer is that it
was a relatively unsophisticated worm with benign behavior,
namely self-reproduction. Since Slammer, researchers have
explored the behaviors of fast spreading worms, and have
designed countermeasures strategies based primarily on rate
detection and limiting algorithms. For example, Zou, et al.,
[2], proposed a scheme where a Kalman filter is used to 
detect the early propagation of a worm. Other researchers
have proposed the use of detectors where rates of 
Destination Unreachable messages are monitored by firewalls, and
a significant increase beyond normal, alerts the 
organization to the potential presence of a worm. However, such
strategies suffer from the fighting the last War syndrome.
That is, systems are being designed and developed to 
effectively contain worms whose behaviors are similar to that of
Slammer.
In the work described here, we put forth the 
hypothesis that next generation worms will be different, and 
therefore such techniques may have some significant limitations.
Specifically, we propose to study a new generation of worms
called Swarm Worms, whose behavior is predicated on the
concept of emergent intelligence. The concept of emergent
intelligence was first studied in association with biological
systems. In such studies, early researchers discovered a 
variety of interesting insect or animal behaviors in the wild.
A flock of birds sweeps across the sky. A group of ants
forages for food. A school of fish swims, turns, flees 
together away from a predator, ands so forth. In general, this
kind of aggregate motion has been called swarm 
behavior. Biologists, and computer scientists in the field of 
artificial intelligence have studied such biological swarms, and
323
attempted to create models that explain how the elements
of a swarm interact, achieve goals, and evolve. Moreover, in
recent years the study of swarm intelligence has become
increasingly important in the fields of robotics, the design
of Mobile ad-hoc Networks (MANETS), the design of 
Intrusion Detection Systems, the study of traffic patterns in
transportation systems, in military applications, and other
areas, see [3].
The basic concepts that have been developed over the last
decade to explain swarms, and swarm behavior include
four basic components. These are:
1. Simplicity of logic & actions: A swarm is composed of
N agents whose intelligence is limited. Agents in the
swarm use simple local rules to govern their actions.
Some models called this primitive actions or behaviors;
2. Local Communication Mechanisms: Agents interact
with other members in the swarm via simple local
communication mechanisms. For example, a bird in a
flock senses the position of adjacent bird and applies
a simple rule of avoidance and follow.
3. Distributed control: Autonomous agents interact with
their environment, which probably consists of other
agents, but act relatively independently from all other
agents. There is no central command or leader, and
certainly there is no global plan.
4. Emergent Intelligence: Aggregate behavior of 
autonomous agents results in complex intelligent 
behaviors; including self-organization.
In order to understand fully the behavior of such swarms
it is necessary to construct a model that explains the 
behavior of what we will call generic worms. This model, which
extends the work by Weaver [5] is presented here in section 2.
In addition, we intend to extend said model in such a way
that it clearly explains the behaviors of this new class of
potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm
Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit
a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed
intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more 
harmful than their similar generic counterparts. Specifically, the
first instance, to our knowledge, of such a learning worm was
created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a simple password 
cracking swarm worm that incorporates different learning and
information sharing strategies. Such a swarm worm was 
deployed in both a local area network of thirty-(30) hosts, as
well as simulated in a 10,000 node topology. Preliminary
results showed that such worms are capable of 
compromising hosts at rates up to two orders of magnitude faster than
their generic counterpart. The rest of this manuscript is
structure as follows. In section 2 an abstract model of both
generic worms as well as swarm worms is presented. This
model is used in section 2.6 to described the first instance
of a swarm worm, ZachiK. In section 4, preliminary results
via both empirical measurements as well as simulation is
presented. Finally, in section 5 our conclusions and insights
into future work are presented.
2. WORM MODELING
In order to study the behavior of swarm worms in general,
it is necessary to create a model that realistically reflects
the structure of worms and it is not necessarily tied to a
specific instance. In this section, we described such a model
where a general worm is describe as having four-(4) basic
components or subfunctions. By definition, a worm is a 
selfcontained, self propagating program. Thus, in simple terms,
it has two main functions: that which propagates and that
which does other things. We propose that there is a third
broad functionality of a worm, that of self-preservation. We
also propose that the other functionality of a worm may
be more appropriately categorized as Goal-Based Actions
(GBA), as whatever functionality included in a worm will
naturally be dependent on whatever goals (and subgoals)
the author has.
The work presented by Weaver et. al. in [5] provides
us with mainly an action and technique based taxonomy of
computer worms, which we utilize and further extend here.
2.1 Propagation
The propagation function itself may be broken down into
three actions: acquire target, send scan, and infect target.
Acquiring the target simply means picking a host to attack
next. Sending a scan involves checking to see if that host is
receptive to an infection attempt, since IP-space is sparsely
populated. This may involve a simple ping to check if the
host is alive or a full out vulnerability assessment. Infecting
the target is the actual method used to send the worm code
to the new host. In algorithm form:
propagate() {
host := acquire_target()
success := send_scan(host)
if( success ) then
infect(host)
endif
}
In the case of a simple worm which does not first check to
see if the host is available or susceptible (such as Slammer),
the scan method is dropped:
propagate() {
host := acquire_target()
infect(host)
}
Each of these actions may have an associated cost to its
inclusion and execution, such as increased worm size and
CPU or network load. Depending on the authors needs or
requirements, these become limiting factors in what may be
included in the worm"s actions. This is discussed further
after expanding upon these actions below.
2.2 Target Acquisition:
The Target Acquisition phase of our worm algorithm is
built directly off of the Target Discovery section in [5]. Weaver
et. al. taxonomize this task into 5 separate categories. Here,
we further extend their work through parameterization.
Scanning: Scanning may be considered an equation-based
method for choosing a host. Any type of equation may be
used to arrive at an IP address, but there are three main
types seen thus far: sequential, random, and local 
preference. Sequential scanning is exactly as it sounds: start at
an IP address and increment through all the IP space. This
could carry with it the options of which IP to start with (user
chosen value, random, or based on IP of infected host) and
324
how many times to increment (continuous, chosen value, or
subnet-based). Random scanning is completely at random
(depending on the chosen PRNG method and its seed value).
Local preference scanning is a variance of either Sequential
or Random, whereby it has a greater probability of 
choosing a local IP address over a remote one (for example, the
traditional 80/20 split).
Pre-generated Target Lists: Pre-generated Target Lists,
or so called hit-lists, could include the options for 
percentage of total population and percentage wrong, or just 
number of IPs to include. Implicit to this type is the fact that the
list is divided among a parent and its children, avoiding the
problem of every instance hitting the exact same machines.
Externally Generated Target Lists: Externally 
generated target lists depend on one or more external sources
that can be queried for host data. This will involve either
servers that are normally publicly available, such as gaming
meta-servers, or ones explicitly setup by the worm or worm
author. The normally available meta-servers could have 
parameters for rates of change, such as many popping up at
night or leaving in the morning. Each server could also have
a maximum queries/second that it would be able to handle.
The worm would also need a way of finding these servers,
either hard-coded or through scanning.
Internal Target Lists: Internal Target Lists are highly
dependent on the infected host. This method could 
parameterize the choice of how much info is on the host, such as all
machines in subnet, all windows boxes in subnet, 
particular servers, number of internal/external, or some 
combination.
Passive: Passive methods are determined by normal
interactions between hosts. Parameters may include a rate
of interaction with particular machines, internal/external
rate of interaction, or subnet-based rate of interaction.
Any of these methods may also be combined to produce
different types of target acquisition strategies. For example,
the a worm may begin with an initial hit-list of 100 different
hosts or subnets. Once it has exhausted its search using the
hit-list, it may then proceed to perform random scanning
with a 50% local bias.
It is important to note, however, that the resource 
consumption of each method is not the same. Different methods
may require the worm to be large, such as the extra bytes 
required by a hit-list, or to take more processing time, such as
by searching the host for addresses of other vulnerable hosts.
Further research and analysis should be performed in this
area to determine associated costs for using each method.
The costs could then be used in determining design 
tradeoffs that worm authors engage at. For example, hit lists
provide a high rate of infection, but at a high cost of worm
payload size.
2.2.1 Sending a Scan
The send scan function tests to see if the host is available
for infection. This can be as simple as checking if the host
is up on the network or as complex as checking if the host is
vulnerable to the exploit which will be used. The sending of
a scan before attempted infection can increaseâ the scanning
rate if the cost for failing an infection is greater than the
cost of failing a scan or sending a scan plus infection; and
failures are more frequent than successes. One important
parameter to this would be the choice of transport protocol
(TCP/UDP) or just simply the time for one successful scan
and time for one failed scan. Also, whether or not it tests
for the host to be up or if it is a full test for the vulnerability
(or for multiple vulnerabilities).
2.2.2 Infection Vector (IV)
The particular infection vector used to access the remote
host is mainly dependent on the particular vulnerability 
chosen to exploit. In a non-specific sense, it is dependent on the
transport protocol chosen to use and the message size to be
sent. Section 3 of [5] also proposes three particular classes
of IV: Self-carried, second channel, and embedded.
2.3 Self Preservation
The Self Preservation actions of a worm may take many
forms. In the wild, worms have been observed to disable
anti-virus software or prevent sending itself to certain 
antivirusknown addresses. They have also been seen to attempt 
disabling of other worms which may be contending for the same
system. We also believe that a time-based throttled 
scanning may help the worm to slip under the radar. We also
propose a decoy method, whereby a worm will release a few
children that cause a lot of noise so that the parent is not
noticed. It has also been proposed [5] that a worm cause
damage to its host if, and only if, it is disturbed in some
way. This module could contain parameters for: probability
of success in disabling anti-virus or other software updates,
probability of being noticed and thus removed, or 
hardening of the host against other worms.
2.4 Goal-Based Actions
A worm"s GBA functionality depends on the author"s goal
list. The Payloads section of [5] provides some useful 
suggestions for such a module. The opening of a back-door can
make the host susceptible to more attacks. This would 
involve a probability of the back-door being used and any 
associated traffic utilization. It could also provide a list of other
worms this host is now susceptible to or a list of 
vulnerabilities this host now has. Spam relays and HTTP-Proxies of
course have an associated bandwidth consumption or traffic
pattern. Internet DoS attacks would have a set time of 
activation, a target, and a traffic pattern. Data damage would
have an associated probability that the host dies because of
the damage.
In Figure 1, this general model of a worm is summarized.
Please note that in this model there is no learning, no, or
very little, sharing of information between worm instances,
and certainly no coordination of actions. In the next 
section we expand the model to include such mechanisms, and
hence, arrive at the general model of a swarm worm.
2.5 Swarms - General Model
As described in section 1, the basic characteristics that
distinguished swarm behavior from simply what appears to
be collective coordinated behaviors are four basic attributes.
These are:
1. Simplicity of logic & actions;
2. Local Communication Mechanisms;
3. Distributed control; and
4. Emergent Intelligence, including self-organization.

Figure 1: General Worm Model
In this work we aggregate all of these attributes under
the general title of Learning, Communication, and 
Distributed Control. The presence of these attributes 
distinguishes swarm worms from otherwise regular worms, or other
types of malware such as Zombies. In figure ??, the generic
model of a worm is expanded to included these set of actions.
Within this context then, a worm like Slammer cannot be
categorized as a swarm worm due to the fact that new 
instances of the worm do not coordinate their actions or share
information. On the other hand, Zombies and many other
forms of DDoS, which at first glance may be consider swarm
worms are not. This is simply due to fact that in the case
of Zombies, control is not distributed but rather centralized,
and no emergent behaviors arise. The latter, the potential
emergence of intelligence or new behaviors is what makes
swarm worms so potentially dangerous. Finally, when one
considers the majority of recent disruptions to the 
Internet Infrastructure, and in light of our description of swarm
attacks, then said disruptions can be easily categorized as
precursors to truly swarm behavior. Specifically,
â¢ DDOS - Large number of compromised hosts send 
useless packets requiring processing (Stacheldraht, http :
//www.cert.org/ incidentnotes/IN â 99 â 04.html).
DDoS attacks are the early precursors to Swarm 
Attacks due to the large number of agents involved.

â¢ Staniford & Paxson in How to Own the Internet in
Your Spare Time? explore modifications to CrV1,
Code Red I, II with a swarm like type of 
behavior. For example, they speculate on new worms which
employ direct worm-to-worm communication, and 
employ programmable updates. For example the Warhol
worm, and Permutation-Scanning (self coordinating)
worms.
2.6 Swarm Worm: the details
In considering the creation of what we believed to be the
first Swarm Worm in existence, we wanted to adhere as
close as possible to the general model presented in section
?? while at the same time facilitating large scale analysis,
both empirical and through simulations, of the behavior of
the swarm. For this reason, we selected as the first instance

Figure 2: General Model of a Swarm Worm
of the swarm a simple password cracking worm. The 
objective of this worm simply is to infect a host by sequentially
attempting to login into the host using well known 
passwords (dictionary attack), passwords that have been 
discovered previously by any member of the swarm, and random
passwords. Once, a host is infected, the worm will create
communication channels with both its known neighbors
at that time, as well as with any offsprings that it 
successfully generates. In this context a successful generation of an
offspring means simply infecting a new host and replicating
an exact copy of itself in such a host. We call this swarm
worm the ZachiK worm in honor of one of its creators. As
it can be seen from this description, the ZachiK worm 
exhibits all of the elements described before. In the following
sections, we described in detail each one of the elements of
the ZachiK worm.
2.7 Infection Vector
The infection vector used for ZachiK worm is the secure
shell protocol SSH. A modified client which is capable of 
receiving passwords from the command line was written, and
integrated with a script that supplies it with various 
passwords: known and random. When a password is found for
an appropriate target, the infection process begins. After
the root password of a host is discovered, the worm infects
the target host and replicates itself. The worm creates a
new directory in the target host, copies the modified ssh
client, the script, the communications servers, and the 
updated versions of data files (list of known passwords and a
list of current neighbors). It then runs the modified script
on the newly infected hosts, which spawns the 
communications server, notifies the neighbors and starts looking for
new targets.
It could be argued, correctly, that the ZachiK worm can be
easily defeated by current countermeasure techniques present
on most systems today, such as disallowing direct root logins
from the network. Within this context ZachiK can quickly
be discarded as very simple and harmless worm that does
not require further study. However, the reader should 
consider the following:
1. ZachiK can be easily modified to include a variety of 
infection vectors. For example, it could be programmed
to guess common user names and their passwords; gain
326
access to a system, then guess the root password or use
other well know vulnerabilities to gain root privileges;
2. ZachiK is a proof of concept worm. The importance
of ZachiK is that it incorporates all of the behaviors of
a swarm worm including, but not restricted to, 
distributed control, communication amongst agents, and
learning;
3. ZachiK is composed of a large collection of agents 
operating independently which lends itself naturally to
parallel algorithms such as a parallel search of the
IPV4 address space. Within this context, SLAMMER,
does incorporate a parallel search capability of 
potentially susceptible addresses. However, unlike ZachiK,
the knowledge discovered by the search is never shared
amongst the agents.
For this reasons, and many others, one should not discard
the potential of this new class of worms but rather embrace
its study.
2.8 Self-Preservation
In the case of ZachiK worm, the main self-preservation
techniques used are simply keeping the payload small. In
this context, this simply means restricting the number of
passwords that an offspring inherits, masquerading worm
messages as common http requests, and restricting the 
number of neighbors to a maximum of five-(5).
2.9 Propagation
Choosing the next target(s) in an efficient matter requires
thought. In the past, known and proposed worms, see [5],
have applied propagation techniques that varied. These 
include: strictly random selection of a potential vulnerable
host; target lists of vulnerable hosts; locally biased random
selection (select a host target at random from a local 
subnet); and a combination of some or all of the above. In
our test and simulation environments, we will apply a 
combination of locally biased and totally random selection of
potential vulnerable hosts. However, due to the fact that
the ZachiK worm is a swarm worm, address discovery (that
is when non-existent addresses are discovered) information
will be shared amongst members of the swarm.
The infection and propagation threads do the following
set of activities repeatedly:
â¢ Choose an address
â¢ Check the validity of the address
â¢ Choose a set of passwords
â¢ Try infecting the selected host with this set of 
passwords
As described earlier, choosing an address makes use of a
combination of random selection, local bias, and target lists.
Specifically, to choose an address, the instance may either:
â¢ Generate a new random address
â¢ Generate an address on the local network
â¢ Pick an address from a handoff list
The choice is made randomly among these options, and can
be varied to test the dependency of propagation on 
particular choices. Password are either chosen from the list of
known passwords or newly generated. When an infection of
a valid address fails, it is added to a list of handoffs, which
is sent to the neighbors to try to work on.
2.10 Learning, CommunicationandDistributed
Control
2.10.1 Communication
The concept of a swarm is based on transfer of 
information amongst neighbors, which relay their new incoming
messages to their neighbors, and so on until every worm 
instance in the swarm is aware of these messages. There are
two classes of messages: data or information messages and
commands. The command messages are meant for an 
external user (a.k.a., hackers and/or crackers) to control the
actions of the instances, and are currently not implemented.
The information messages are currently of three kinds: new
member, passwords and exploitable addresses (handoffs).
The new member messages are messages that a new instance
sends to the neighbors on its (short) list of initial neighbors.
The neighbors then register these instances in their neighbor
list. These are messages that form the multi-connectivity of
the swarm, and without them, the topology will be a 
treelike structure, where eliminating a single node would cause
the instances beneath it to be inaccessible. The passwords
messages inform instances of newly discovered passwords,
and by informing all instances, the swarm as whole collects
this information, which allows it to infect new instances
more effectively. The handoffs messages inform instances
of valid addresses that could not be compromised (fail at
breaking the password for the root account). Since the 
address space is rather sparse, it takes a relatively long time
(i.e. many trials) to discover a valid address. Therefore, by
handing off discovered valid addresses, the swarm is (a) 
conserving energy by not re-discovering the same addresses
(b) attacking more effectively. In a way, this is a simple
instance of coordinated activity of a swarm.
2.10.2 Coordination
When a worm instance is born, it relays its existence
to all neighbors on its list. The main thread then spawns
a few infection threads, and continues to handle incoming
messages (registering neighbors, adding new passwords, 
receiving addresses and relaying these messages).
2.10.3 Distributed Control
Control in the ZachiK worm is distributed in the sense
that each instance of the worm performs a set of actions 
independently of every other instance while at the same time
benefiting from the learning achieve by its immediate 
neighbors.
2.11 Goal Based Actions
The first instantiation of the ZachiK worm has two basic
goals. These are: (1) propagate, and (2) discover and share
with members of th swarm new root passwords.
3. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
In order to verify our hypothesis that Swarm Worms are
more capable, and therefore dangerous than other well known
327
worms, a network testbed was created, and a simulator,
capable of simulating large scale Internet-like topologies
(IPV4 space), was developed. The network testbed 
consisted of a local area network of 30 Linux based computers.
The simulator was written in C++
. The simple swarm worm
described in section 2.6 was used to infect patient-zero, and
then the swarm worm was allowed to propagate via its own
mechanisms of propagation, distributed control, and swarm
behaviors.
In the case of a simple local area network of 30 
computers, six-(6) different root passwords out of a password space
of 4 digits (10000 options) were selected. At the start of
the experiment a single known password is known, that of
patient-zero. All shared passwords are distributed randomly
across all nodes. Similarly, in the case of the simulation, a
network topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were 
selected randomly across the IPV4 space, was constructed.
Within that space, a total of 200 shared passwords were 
selected and distributed either randomly and/or targeted to
specific network topologies subnets. For example, in one of
our simulation runs, the network topology consisted of 200
subnets each containing 50 hosts. In such a topology, shared
passwords were distributed across subnets where a varying
percentage of passwords were shared across subnets. The
percentages of shared passwords used was reflective of early
empirical studies, where up to 39.7% of common passwords
were found to be shared.
4. RESULTS
In Figure 3, the results comparing Swarm Attack behavior
versus that of a typical Malform Worm for a 30 node LAN
are presented. In this set of empirical runs, six-(6) shared
passwords were distributed at random across all nodes from
a possible of 10,000 unknown passwords. The data presented
reflects the behaviors of a total of three-(3) distinct classes
of worm or swarm worms. The class of worms presented are
as follows:
â¢ I-NS-NL:= Generic worm, independent (I), no 
learning/memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information
with neighbors or offsprings (NS);
â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP)
across nearest neighbors and offsprings; and
â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and 
existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and
offsprings.
As it is shown in Figure 3, the results validate our original
hypothesis that swarm worms are significantly more efficient
and dangerous than generic worms. In this set of 
experiments, the sharing of passwords provides an order of 
magnitude improvement over a memoryless random worm. 
Similarly, a swarm worm that shares passwords and addresses is
approximately two orders of magnitude more efficient than
its generic counterpart.
In Figure 3, a series of discontinuities can be observed.
These discontinuities are an artifact of the small sample
space used for this experiment. Basically, as soon as a 
password is broken, all nodes sharing that specific password are
infected within a few seconds. Note that it is trivial for a
swarm worm to scan and discovered a small shared password
space.
In Figure 4, the simulation results comparing Swarm 
Attack Behavior versus that of a Generic Malform Worm are
presented. In this set of simulation runs, a network 
topology of 10,000 hosts, whose addresses were selected randomly
across the IPV4 space, was constructed. Within that space,
a total of 200 shared passwords were selected and distributed
either randomly and/or targeted to specific network 
topologies subnets. The data presented reflects the behaviors of
three-(3) distinct classes of worm or swarm worms and 
two(2) different target host selection scanning strategies 
(random scanning and local bias). The amount of local bias
was varied across multiple simulation runs. The results 
presented are aggregate behaviors. In general the following
class of Generic Worms and Swarm Worms were simulated.
Address Scanning:
â¢ Random:= addresses are selected at random from a
subset of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224
address space;
and
â¢ Local Bias:= addresses are selected at random from
either a local subnet (256 addresses) or from a subset
of the IPV4 space, namely, a 224
address space. The
percentage of local bias is varied across multiple runs.
Learning, Communication & Distributed Control
â¢ I-NL-NS: Generic worm, independent (I), no learning/
memoryless (NL), and no sharing of information with
neighbors or offsprings (NS);
â¢ I-L-OOS: Generic worm, independent (I), learning/
memoryless (L), and one time sharing of information
with offsprings only (OOS);
â¢ S-L-SP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords (SP)
across nearest neighbors and offsprings;
â¢ S-L-S&AOP:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps
list of learned passwords, and sharing of addresses with
neighbors and offsprings, shares passwords one time
only (at creation) with offsprings(SA&OP);
â¢ S-L-SP&A:= Swarm Worm (S), learning (L), keeps list
of learned passwords, and sharing of passwords and 
existent addresses (SP&A) across nearest neighbors and
offsprings.
As it is shown in Figure 4, the results are consistent with
our set of empirical results. In addition, the following 
observations can be made.
1. Local preference is incredibly effective.
2. Short address handoffs are more effective than long
ones. We varied the size of the list allowed in the
sharing of addresses; the overhead associated with a
long address list is detrimental to the performance of
the swarm worm, as well as to its stealthiness;
3. For the local bias case, sharing valid addresses of 
susceptible host, S-L-S&AOP worm (recall, the S-L-S&AOP
swarm shares passwords, one time only, with offsprings
328
at creation time) is more effective than sharing 
passwords in the case of the S-L-SP swarm. In this case,
we can think of the swarm as launching a 
distributeddictionary attack: different segments of the swarm use
different passwords to try to break into susceptible 
uninfected host. In the local bias mode, early in the life
of the swarm, address-sharing is more effective than
password-sharing, until most subnets are discovered.
Then the targeting of local addresses assists in 
discovering the susceptible hosts, while the swarm members
need to waste time rediscovering passwords; and
4. Infecting the last 0.5% of nodes takes a very long time
in non-local bias mode. Basically, the shared password
list across subnets has been exhausted, and the swarm
reverts to simply a random discovery of password 
algorithm.

5. SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK
In this manuscript, we have presented an abstract model,
similar in some aspects to that of Weaver [5], that helps
explain the generic nature of worms. The model presented
in section 2 was extended to incorporate a new class of 
potentially dangerous worms called Swarm Worms. Swarm
Worms behave very much like biological swarms and exhibit
a high degree of learning, communication, and distributed
intelligence. Such Swarm Worms are potentially more 
harmful than their generic counterparts.
In addition, the first instance, to our knowledge, of such a
learning worm was created, called ZachiK. ZachiK is a 
simple password cracking swarm worm that incorporates 
different learning and information sharing strategies. Such a
swarm worm was deployed in both a local area network of
thirty-(30) hosts, as well as simulated in a 10,000 node 
topology. Preliminary results showed that such worms is capable
of compromising hosts a rates up to 2 orders of magnitude
faster than its generic counterpart while retaining stealth
capabilities.
This work opens up a new area of interesting problems.
Some of the most interesting and pressing problems to be
consider are as follows:
â¢ Is it possible to apply some of learning concepts 
developed over the last ten years in the areas of swarm
intelligence, agent systems, and distributed control to
the design of sophisticated swarm worms in such a way
that true emergent behavior takes place?
â¢ Are the current techniques being developed in the 
design of Intrusion Detection & CounterMeasure 
Systems and Survivable systems effective against this new
class of worms?; and
â¢ What techniques, if any, can be developed to create
defenses against swarm worms?
