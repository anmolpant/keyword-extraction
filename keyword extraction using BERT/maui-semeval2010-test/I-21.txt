ABSTRACT
We investigate a framework where agents search for 
satisfying products by using referrals from other agents. Our
model of a mechanism for transmitting word-of-mouth and
the resulting behavioural effects is based on integrating a
module governing the local behaviour of agents with a 
module governing the structure and function of the underlying
network of agents. Local behaviour incorporates a 
satisficing model of choice, a set of rules governing the 
interactions between agents, including learning about the 
trustworthiness of other agents over time, and external constraints
on behaviour that may be imposed by market barriers or
switching costs. Local behaviour takes place on a network
substrate across which agents exchange positive and 
negative information about products. We use various degree
distributions dictating the extent of connectivity, and 
incorporate both small-world effects and the notion of preferential
attachment in our network models. We compare the 
effectiveness of referral systems over various network structures
for easy and hard choice tasks, and evaluate how this 
effectiveness changes with the imposition of market barriers.

1. INTRODUCTION
Defection behaviour, that is, why people might stop 
using a particular product or service, largely depends on the
psychological affinity or satisfaction that they feel toward
the currently-used product [14] and the availability of more
attractive alternatives [17]. However, in many cases the 
decision about whether to defect or not is also dependent on
various external constraints that are placed on switching 
behaviour, either by the structure of the market, by the 
suppliers themselves (in the guise of formal or informal contracts),
or other so-called ‘switching costs" or market barriers [12, 5].
The key feature of all these cases is that the extent to which
psychological affinity plays a role in actual decision-making
is constrained by market barriers, so that agents are 
prevented from pursuing those courses of action which would
be most satisfying in an unconstrained market.
While the level of satisfaction with a currently-used 
product will largely be a function of one"s own experiences of
the product over the period of use, knowledge of any 
potentially more satisfying alternatives is likely to be gained
by augmenting the information gained from personal 
experiences with information about the experiences of others 
gathered from casual word-of-mouth communication. Moreover,
there is an important relationship between market barriers
and word-of-mouth communication. In the presence of 
market barriers, constrained economic agents trapped in 
dissatisfying product relationships will tend to disseminate this
information to other agents. In the absence of such 
barriers, agents are free to defect from unsatisfying products
and word-of-mouth communication would thus tend to be
of the positive variety. Since the imposition of at least some
forms of market barriers is often a strategic decision taken
by product suppliers, these relationships may be key to the
success of a particular supplier.
In addition, the relationship between market barriers and
word-of-mouth communication may be a reciprocal one. The
structure and function of the network across which 
word-ofmouth communication is conducted, and particularly the
way in which the network changes in response to the 
imposition of market barriers, also plays a role in determining
which market barriers are most effective. These are complex
questions, and our main interest in this paper is to address
the simpler problems of investigating (a) the extent to which
network structure influences the ways in which information
is disseminated across a network of decision makers, (b) the
extent to which market barriers affect this dissemination,
and (c) the consequent implications for overall system 
performance, in terms of the proportion of agents who are 
satisfied, and the speed with which the system moves towards
equilibrium, which we term stability.
An agent-based model framework allows for an 
investigation at the level of the individual decision maker, at the
387
978-81-904262-7-5 (RPS) c 2007 IFAAMAS
product-level, or at the level of the entire system; we are 
particularly interested in the implications of market barriers for
the latter two. The model presented here allows for an 
investigation into the effects of market barriers to be carried
out in a complex environment where at every time period
each agent in a population must decide which one of a set of
products to purchase. These decisions are based on 
multiattribute information gathered by personal product trials as
well as from the referrals of agents. Agents use this gathered
information to search for a product that exceeds their 
satisfaction thresholds on all attributes - so that the agents may
be said to be satisficing rather than optimising (e.g. [15]).
Market barriers may act to influence an agent to continue
to use a product that is no longer offering satisfactory 
performance. We allow agents to hold different opinions about
the performance of a product, so that as a result a referral
from another agent may not lead to a satisfying experience.
Agents therefore adjust their evaluations of the validity of
other agents" referrals according to the success of past 
referrals, and use these evaluations to judge whether or not
to make use of any further referrals. The level of 
satisfaction provided to an agent by a product is itself inherently
dynamic, being subject to random fluctuations in product
performance as well as a tendency for an agent to discount
the performance of a product they have used for a long time
- a process akin to habituation.
2. BACKGROUND
2.1 Word-of-mouth communication
Much of the work done on word-of-mouth communication
in the context of social psychology and marketing research
has focused on its forms and determinants, suggesting that
word-of-mouth arises in three possible ways: it may be 
induced by a particular transaction or product experience [11],
particularly when that transaction has been an especially
good or bad one [1]; it may be solicited from others [10],
usually when the task involved is difficult, ambiguous, or
new [7]; and it may come about when talk of products and
brands arise in the course of informal conversation, 
particularly when a ‘passion for the subject" is present [4]. 
Wordof-mouth becomes more influential when the source of the
communication is credible, with credibility decisions based
largely on one or a combination of evaluations of professional
qualification, informal training, social distance [7], and 
similarity of views and experiences [3].
The role of word-of-mouth communication on the behaviour
of complex systems has been studied in both analytical and
simulation models. The analytical work in [8] investigates
the conditions under which word-of-mouth leads to 
conformity in behaviour and the adoption of socially efficient 
outcomes (e.g. choosing an alternative that is on average better
than another), finding that conformity of behaviour arises
when agents are exposed to word-of-mouth communication
from only a small number of other agents, but that this 
conformity may result in socially inefficient outcomes where the
tendency toward conformity is so strong that it overwhelms
the influence of the superior payoffs provided by the socially
efficient outcome. Simulation-based investigations of 
wordof-mouth [6, 13] have focused on developing strategies for
ensuring that a system reaches an equilibrium level where
all agents are satisfied, largely by learning about the 
effectiveness of others" referrals or by varying the degree of 
inertia in individual behaviour. These studies have found that,
given a sufficient number of service providers, honest 
referrals lead to faster convergence to satisfactory distributions
than deceitful ones, and that both forms of word-of-mouth
provide better performance than none at all. The 
simulation framework allows for a more complex modelling of the
environment than the analytical models, in which referrals
are at random and only two choices are available, and the
work in [6] in particular is a close antecedent of the work 
presented in this paper, our main contribution being to include
network structure and the constraints imposed by market
barriers as additional effects.
2.2 Market barriers
The extent to which market barriers are influential in
affecting systems behaviour draws attention mostly from
economists interested in how barriers distort competition
and marketers interested in how barriers distort consumer
choices. While the formalisation of the idea that 
satisfaction drives purchase behaviour can be traced back to the
work of Fishbein and Ajzen [9] on reasoned choice, nearly
all writers, including Fishbein and Ajzen, recognise that this
relationship can be thwarted by circumstances (e.g. [17]).
A useful typology of market barriers distinguishes 
‘transactional" barriers associated with the monetary cost of 
changing (e.g. in financial services), ‘learning" barriers associated
with deciding to replace well-known existing products, and
‘contractual" barriers imposing legal constraints for the term
of the contract [12]. A different typology [5] introduces the
additional aspect of ‘relational" barriers arising from 
personal relationships that may be interwoven with the use of
a particular product.
There is generally little empirical evidence on the 
relationship between the creation of barriers to switching and the 
retention of a customer base, and to the best of our knowledge
no previous work using agent-based modelling to generate
empirical findings. Burnham et al. [5] find that perceived
market barriers account for nearly twice the variance in 
intention to stay with a product than that explained by 
satisfaction with the product (30% and 16% respectively), and
that so-called relational barriers are considerably more 
influential than either transactional or learning barriers. Further,
they find that switching costs are perceived by consumers
to exist even in markets which are fluid and where barriers
would seem to be weak. Simply put, market barriers appear
to play a greater role in what people do than satisfaction;
and their presence may be more pervasive than is generally
thought.
3. MODEL FRAMEWORK
3.1 Product performance evaluations
We use a problem representation in which, at each time
period, every agent must decide which one of a set of 
products to choose. Let A = {ak}k=1...p be the set of agents,
B = {bi}i=1...n be the set of products, and C = {cj }j=1...m
be the set of attributes on which the choice decision is to be
based i.e. the decision to be made is a multiattribute choice
one. Let fj : B → [0, 1] be an increasing function 
providing the intrinsic performance of a product on attribute j (so
that 0 and 1 are the worst- and best-possible performances
respectively), and Sij : A × [0, 1] → [0, 1] be a subjective
opinion function of agents. The intrinsic performance of
388 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
product i on attribute j is given by fj (bi). However, the
subjective opinion of the level of performance (of product i
on attribute j) given by agent k is given by sij(ak, fj (bi)).
All subsequent modelling is based on these subjective 
performance ratings. For the purposes of this paper, each agent
belongs to one of three equally-sized groups, with each group
possessing its own subjective performance ratings.
We assume that the subjective performance ratings are
not known a priori by the agents, and it is their task to 
discover these ratings by a combination of personal exploration
and referral gathering. In order to model this process we 
introduce the notion of perceived performance ratings at time
t, denoted by pij(ak, fj (bi), t). Initially, all perceived 
performance ratings are set to zero, so that the initial selection of a
product is done randomly. Subsequent variation in product
performance over time is modelled using two quantities: a
random perturbation jkt applied at each purchase occasion
ensures that the experience of a particular product can vary
over purchase occasions for the same agent, and a 
habituation discounting factor Hikt tends to decrease the perceived
performance of a product over time as boredom creeps in
with repeated usage. Our habituation mechanism supposes
that habituation builds up with repeated use of a product,
and is used to discount the performance of the product.
In most cases i.e. unless the habituation factor is one or
extremely close to one, this habituation-based discounting
eventually leads to defection, after which the level of 
habituation dissipates as time passes without the product being
used. More formally, once a product i∗
has been chosen by
agent k, the subjective level of performance is perceived and
pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ), t) is set equal to si∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ))Hi∗kt + jkt,
where jkt is distributed as N(0, σ) and Hi∗kt is an 
decreasing function of the number of time periods that agent k has
been exposed to i∗
.
In evaluating the performance of a product, agents make
use of a satisficing framework by comparing the perceived
performance of the chosen product with their satisfaction
thresholds Γk = {g1k, . . . , gmk}, with 0 ≤ gik ≤ 1. Agent
k will be satisfied with a product i∗
selected in time t if
pi∗j(ak, fj (b∗
i ), t) ≥ gjk, ∀j.
3.2 Decision processes
In designing the mechanism by which agents make their
choice decisions, we allow for the possibility that satisfied
agents defect from the products that are currently satisfying
them. Satisfied agents stay with their current product with
probability Pr(stay), with a strategy prohibiting satisfied
agents from moving (e.g. [6]) obtained as a special case when
Pr(stay) = 1.
A defecting satisfied agent decides on which product to
choose by considering all other products for which it has
information, either by previous personal exploration or by
referrals from other agents. The selection of a new 
product begins by the agent identifying those products from
which he or she expects to gain a satisfactory performance
on all attributes i.e. those products for which δik < 0, where
δik = maxj [gjk − pij(ak, fj(bi), t)], and selecting a 
product from this set with selection probabilities proportional to
−δik. If no satisfactory product exists (or at least the agent
is unaware of any such product) the agent identifies those
products that offer at least a minimum level of ‘acceptable"
performance γ−
k . The minimum level of acceptability is 
defined as the maximum deviation from his or her aspirations
across all attributes that the agent is willing to accept i.e.
a product is minimally acceptable if and only if δik < γ−
k .
Agents then select a product at random from the set of 
minimally acceptable products. If the set of minimally 
acceptable products is empty, agents select a product from the full
set of products B at random.
The decision process followed by unsatisfied agents is largely
similar to that of defecting satisfied agents, with the 
exception that at the outset of the decision process agents will
chose to explore a new product, chosen at random from the
set of remaining products, with probability α. With 
probability 1 − α, they will use a decision process like the one
outlined above for satisfied agents.
3.3 Constraints on decision processes
In some circumstances market barriers may exist that
make switching between products more difficult, 
particularly where some switching costs are incurred as a result of
changing one"s choice of product. When barriers are present,
agents do not switch when they become unsatisfied, but
rather only when the performance evaluation drops below
some critical level i.e. when δik > β, where β > 0 measures
the strength of the market barriers. Although in this 
paper market barriers do not vary over products or time, it is
straightforward to allow this to occur by allowing barriers
take the general form β = max(β∗ +Δtuse, β∗
), where β∗ is a
barrier to defection that is applied when the product is 
purchased for the first time (e.g. a contractual agreement), Δ is
the increase in barriers that are incurred for every additional
time period the product is used for, and β∗
is the maximum
possible barrier, and all three quantities are allowed to vary
over products i.e. be a function of i.
3.4 Referral processes
Each agent is assumed to be connected to qk < p agents
i.e. to give and receive information from qk other agents.
The network over which word-of-mouth communication 
travels is governed by the small-world effect [18], by which 
networks simultaneously exhibit a high degree of clustering of
agents into ‘communities" and a short average path length
between any two agents in the network, and preferential
attachment [2], by which agents with greater numbers of
existing connections are more likely to receive new ones.
This is easily achieved by building a one-dimensional lattice
with connections between all agent pairs separated by κ or
fewer lattice spacings, and creating a small-world network
by choosing at random a small fraction r of the connections
in the network and moving one end of each to a new agent,
with that new agent chosen with probability proportional to
its number of existing connections. This results in a 
distribution of the number of connections possessed by each agent
i.e. a distribution of qk, that is strongly skewed to the right.
In fact, if the construction of the network is slightly modified
so that new connections are added with preferential 
attachment (but no connections are removed), the distribution of
qk follows a power-law distribution, but a distribution with a
non-zero probability of an agent having less than the modal
number of connections seems more realistic in the context
of word-of-mouth communication in marketing systems.
When an agent purchases a product, they inform each
of the other agents in their circle with probability equal to
Pr(spr)k∗ + |δik∗ |, where Pr(spr)k∗ is the basic propensity
of agent k∗
to spread word of mouth and δik∗ captures the
The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07) 389
extent to which the agent"s most recent experience was 
satisfying or dissatisfying. Agents are thus more likely to spread
word-of-mouth about products that they have just 
experienced as either very good or very bad. If an agent receives
information on the same product from more than one agent,
he or she selects the referral of only one of these agents, with
selection probabilities proportional to Tt(k∗
, k), the degree
to which previous referrals from k∗
to k were successful i.e.
resulted in satisfying experiences for agent k. Thus agents
have the capacity to learn about the quality of other agents"
referrals and use this information to accept or block future
referrals. In this paper, we employ a learning condition in
which Tt(k∗
, k) is multiplied by a factor of 0.1 following an
unsatisfying referral and a factor of 3 following a satisfying
referral. The asymmetry in the weighting is similar to that
employed in [16], and is motivated by the fact that an 
unsatisfying referral is likely to be more reliable evidence that a
referring agent k∗
does not possess the same subjective 
preferences as agent k than a positive referral is of indicating the
converse.
Other referral process are certainly possible, for 
example one integrating multiple sources of word-of-mouth rather
than choosing only the most-trusted source: our main 
reason for employing the process described above is 
simplicity. Integrating different sources considerably complicates
the process of learning about the trustworthiness of others,
and raises further questions about the precise nature of the
integration.
After determining who contacts whom, the actual 
referral is modelled as a transmittance of information about the
perceived level of performance of an experience of product
i∗
from the referring agent k∗
to the accepting agent k i.e.
pi∗j(ak, fj (bi), t) takes on the value pi∗j(ak∗ , fj(bi), t−1), ∀j,
provided that agent k is not currently using i∗
. Information
about other products is not transmitted, and an agent will
ignore any word-of-mouth about the product he or she is
currently using. In effect, the referral creates an expected
level of performance in the mind of an accepting agent for
the product referred to, which that agent may then use when
making choice decision in subsequent time periods using the
decision processes outlined in the previous section. Once an
agent has personally experienced a product, any expected
performance levels suggested by previous referrals are 
replaced by the experienced (subjective) performance levels
sij(ak, fj(bi)) + jkt and Tt(k∗
, k) is adjusted depending on
whether the experience was a satisfying one or not.
4. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
We examine the behaviour of a system of 200 agents 
consisting of three groups of 67, 67, and 66 agents respectively.
Agents in each of the three groups have homogeneous 
subjective opinion functions Sij. Simulations were run for 500
time periods, and twenty repetitions of each condition were
used in order to generate aggregate results.
4.1 Choice task difficulty
We begin by examining the effect of task difficulty on
the ability of various network configurations to converge to
a state in which an acceptable proportion of the 
population are satisfied. In the ‘easy" choice condition, there are
50 products to choose from in the market, evaluated over
4 attributes with all satisfaction thresholds set to 0.5 for
all groups. There are therefore on average approximately
3 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular
agent. In the ‘hard" choice condition, there are 500 
products to choose from in the market, still evaluated over 4
attributes but with all satisfaction thresholds now set to
0.7 for all groups, so there are on average approximately
4 products that can be expected to satisfy any particular
agent. Locating a satisfactory product is therefore far more
difficult under the ‘hard" condition. The effect of task 
difficulty is evaluated on three network structures 
corresponding to r = 1 (random network), r = 0.05 (small-world 
network), and r = 0 (tight ‘communities" of agents), with 
results shown in Figure 1 for the case of κ = 3.

Figure 1: Moderating effect of task difficulty on 
relationship between network structure (r) and system
behaviour
Given a relatively easy task, the system very quickly i.e. in
little over 50 time periods, converges to a state in which
just less than 60% of agents are satisfied at any one time.
Furthermore, different network structures have very little
influence on results, so that only a single (smoothed) series
is given for comparison with the ‘hard" condition. Clearly,
there are enough agents independently solving the task i.e.
390 The Sixth Intl. Joint Conf. on Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (AAMAS 07)
finding a satisfying brand, to make the dissemination of 
information relatively independent of the ways in which 
connections are made. However, when it is more difficult to
locate a satisfying product, the structure of the network 
becomes integral to the speed at which the system converges
to a stable state. Importantly, the overall satisfaction level
to which the system converges remains just below 60% 
regardless of which network structure is used, but convergence
is considerably speeded by the random rewiring of even a
small proportion of connections. Thus while the random
network (r = 1) converges quickest, the small-world 
network (r = 0.05) also shows a substantial improvement over
the tight communities represented by the one-dimensional
ring lattice. This effect of the rewiring parameter r is much
less pronounced for more highly-connected networks (e.g.
κ = 9), which suggests that the degree distribution of a 
network is a more important determinant of system behaviour
than the way in which agents are connected to one another.
Similar results are observed when looking at the market
share achieved by the market leading product under each
level of choice difficulty: market share is essentially 
independent of network structure for the easy task, with 
average share converging quickly to around 35%. Set a more
difficult task, the convergence of market share to an 
approximate long-run equilibrium is in fact fastest for the 
smallworld network, with the random and tight community 
networks taking different paths but similar times to reach their
equilibrium levels. Also interesting is the finding that 
equilibrium market shares for the market leader appear to be
slightly (of the order of 5-10%) higher when network 
connections are non-random - the random network seems to
suffer more from the effects of habituatation than the other
networks as a result of the rapid early adoption of the 
market leading product.
4.2 Market barriers
In the remainder of this paper we focus on the effect of
various forms of market barriers on the ability of a system of
agents to reach a state of acceptable satisfaction. For 
simplicity, we concentrate on the smaller set of 50 products i.e.
the ‘easy" choice task discussed above, but vary the 
number of connections that each agent begins with in order to
simultaneously investigate the effect of degree distribution
on system behaviour. Tables 1 and 2 show the effect of 
different degree distributions on the equilibrium proportion of
agents that are satisfied at any one time, and the 
equilibrium proportion of agents switching products (moving) in
any one time period, under various levels of market barriers
constraining their behaviour. In these two tables, 
equilibrium results have been calculated by averaging over time
periods 450 to 500, when the system is in equilibrium or
extremely close to equilibrium (Table 3 and 4 make use of
all time periods).

Table 2: Effect of degree distribution and market
barriers on proportion of market moving
Three aspects are worth noting. Firstly, there is a strong
diminishing marginal return of additional connections 
beyond a small number. The first few connections one makes
increases the probability of finding a satisfying product 60%
from 0.27 to 0.44 (for the first two contacts), followed by a
further increase of roughly 25% to 0.56 for the next four.
In contrast, adding a further 12 contacts improves relative
satisfaction levels by less than 4%. Secondly, word-of-mouth
communication continues to play an important role in 
improving the performance of the system even when market
barriers are high. In fact, the role may even be more 
important in constrained conditions, since the relative gains
obtained from word-of-mouth are greater the higher market
barriers are - just having two contacts more than doubles
the aggregate satisfaction level under the most extreme 
barriers (β = 0.4). Finally, it is clear that the mechanism by
which barriers reduce satisfaction is by restricting movement
(reflected in the lower proportion of agents moving in any
particular column of Tables 1 and 2), but that increases in
degree distribution act to increase satisfaction by precisely
the same mechanism of reducing movement - this time by
reducing the average amount of time required to find a 
satisfying brand.

Table 3: Median number of positive and negative
referrals made per agent per time period
Perhaps the most interesting effects exerted by market 
barriers are those exerted over the market shares of leading
products. Figure 2 shows the cumulative market share 
captured by the top three products in the market over time, for
all types of market barriers using different degree 
distributions. Again, two comments can be made. Firstly, in the
absence of market barriers, a greater proportion of the 
market is captured by the market leading products when 
markets are highly-connected relative to when they are 
poorlyconnected. This difference can amount to as much as 15%,
and is explained by positive feedback within the more 
highlyconnected networks that serves to increase the probability
that, once a set of satisfying products have emerged, one
is kept informed about these leading products because at
least one of one"s contacts is using it. Secondly, the 
relatively higher market share enjoyed by market leaders in
highly-connected networks is eroded by market barriers. In
moving from β = 0 to β = 0.2 to β = 0.4, market leaders
collectively lose an absolute share of 15% and 10% under
the larger degree distributions κ = 9 and κ = 3 respectively.

Figure 2: Effect of market barriers on the share of the market captured by the leading 3 products
In contrast, no change in collective market share is observed
when κ = 1, although convergence to equilibrium conditions
is slower. It seems reasonable to suggest that increases in
negative word-of-mouth, which occurs when an unsatisfied
agent is prevented from switching to another product, are
particularly damaging to leading products when agents are
well-connected, and that under moderate to strong market
barriers these effects more than offset any gains achieved by
the spread of positive word-of-mouth through the network.
Table 3 displays the number of attempted referrals, both
positive and negative, as a function of degree distribution
and extent of market barriers, and shows that stronger 
market barriers act to simultaneously depress positive 
word-ofmouth communication and increase negative 
communication from those trapped in unsatisfying product 
relationships, and that this effect is particularly pronounced for
more highly-connected networks. The reduction in the 
number of positive referrals as market barriers impose 
increasingly severe constraints is also reflected in Table 4, which
shows the median number of product trials each agent makes
per time period based on a referral from another agent.
Whereas under few or no barriers agents in a highly-connected
network make substantially more reference-based product
trials than agents in poorly-connected networks, when 
barriers are severe both types of network carry only very little
positive referral information. This clearly has a relatively
greater impact on the highly-connected network, which 
relies on the spread of positive referral information to achieve
higher satisfaction levels. Moreover, this result might be
even stronger in reality if agents in poorly-connected 
networks attempt to compensate for the relative sparcity of
connections by making more forceful or persuasive referrals
where they do occur.

5. CONCLUSIONS AND RELATED WORK
Purchasing behaviour in many markets takes place on
a substrate of networks of word-of-mouth communication
across which agents exchange information about products
and their likes and dislikes. Understanding the ways in
which flows of word-of-mouth communication influence 
aggregate market behaviour requires one to study both the
underlying structural properties of the network and the 
local rules governing the behaviour of agents on the network
when making purchase decisions and when interacting with
other agents. These local rules are often constrained by the
nature of a particular market, or else imposed by 
strategic suppliers or social customs. The proper modelling of a
mechanism for word-of-mouth transmittal and resulting 
behavioural effects thus requires a consideration of a number of
complex and interacting components: networks of 
communication, source credibility, learning processes, habituation
and memory, external constraints on behaviour, theories of
information transfer, and adaptive behaviour. In this 
paper we have attempted to address some of these issues in
a manner which reflects how agents might act in the real
world.
Using the key notions of a limited communication 
network, a simple learning process, and a satisficing heuristic
that may be subject to external constraints, we showed (1)
the importance of word-of-mouth communication to both
system effectiveness and stability, (2) that the degree 
distribution of a network is more influential than the way in
which agents are connected, but that both are important in
more complex environments, (3) that rewiring even a small
number of connections to create a small-world network can
have dramatic results for the speed of convergence to 
satisficing distributions and market share allocations, (4) that
word-of-mouth continues to be effective when movements
between products are constrained by market barriers, and
(5) that increases in negative word-of-mouth incurred as a
result of market barriers can reduce the market share 
collectively captured by leading brands, but that this is dependent
on the existence of a suitably well-connected network 
structure.
It is the final finding that is likely to be most 
surprising and practically relevant for the marketing research field,
and suggests that it may not always be in the best 
interests of a market leader to impose barriers that prevent 
customers from leaving. In poorly-connected networks, the 
effect of barriers on market shares is slight. In contrast, in
well-connected networks, negative word-of-mouth can 
prevent agents from trying a product that they might 
otherwise have found satisfying, and this can inflict significant
harm on market share. Products with small market share
(which, in the context of our simulations, is generally due to
the product offering poor performance) are relatively 
unaffected by negative word-of-mouth, since most product trials
are likely to be unsatisfying in any case.
Agent-based modelling provides a natural way for 
beginning to investigate the types of dynamics that occur in 
marketing systems. Naturally the usefulness of results is for the
most part dependent on the quality of the modelling of the
two ‘modules" comprising network structure and local 
behaviour. On the network side, future work might investigate
the relationship between degree distributions, the way 
connections are created and destroyed over time, whether 
preferential attachment is influential, and the extent to which
social identity informs network strucutre, all in larger 
networks of more heterogenous agents. On the behavioural side,
one might look at the adaptation of satisfaction thresholds
during the course of communication, responses to systematic
changes in product performances over time, the integration
of various information sources, and different market barrier
structures. All these areas provide fascinating opportunities
to introduce psychological realities into models of 
marketing systems and to observe the resulting behaviour of the
system under increasingly realistic scenario descriptions.
