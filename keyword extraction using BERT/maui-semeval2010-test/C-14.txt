ABSTRACT
In order to monitor a region for traffic traversal, sensors
can be deployed to perform collaborative target detection.
Such a sensor network achieves a certain level of detection
performance with an associated cost of deployment. This
paper addresses this problem by proposing path exposure
as a measure of the goodness of a deployment and presents
an approach for sequential deployment in steps. It illustrates
that the cost of deployment can be minimized to achieve the
desired detection performance by appropriately choosing the
number of sensors deployed in each step.

1. INTRODUCTION
Recent advances in computing hardware and software are
responsible for the emergence of sensor networks capable of
observing the environment, processing the data and making
decisions based on the observations. Such a network can
be used to monitor the environment, detect, classify and 
locate specific events, and track targets over a specific region.
Examples of such systems are in surveillance, monitoring of
pollution, traffic, agriculture or civil infrastructures [6]. The
deployment of sensor networks varies with the application
considered. It can be predetermined when the environment
is sufficiently known and under control, in which case the
sensors can be strategically hand placed. The deployment
can also be a priori undetermined when the environment is
unknown or hostile in which case the sensors may be 
airdropped from an aircraft or deployed by other means, 
generally resulting in a random placement.
This paper investigates deployment strategies for sensor
networks performing target detection over a region of 
interest. In order to detect a target moving through the region,
sensors have to make local observations of the environment
and collaborate to produce a global decision that reflects the
status of the region covered [2]. This collaboration requires
local processing of the observations, communication between
different nodes, and information fusion [7]. Since the local
observations made by the sensors depend on their position,
the performance of the detection algorithm is a function of
the deployment. One possible measure of the goodness of
deployment for target detection is called path exposure. It is
a measure of the likelihood of detecting a target traversing
the region using a given path. The higher the path 
exposure, the better the deployment. The set of paths to be
considered may be constrained by the environment. For 
example, if the target is expected to be following a road, only
the paths consisting of the roads need to be considered.
In this study, the deployment is assumed to be random
which corresponds to many practical applications where the
region to be monitored is not accessible for precise 
placement of sensors. The focus of this paper is to determine the
number of sensors to be deployed to carry out target 
detection in a region of interest. The tradeoffs lie between the
network performance, the cost of the sensors deployed, and
the cost of deploying the sensors. This paper is organized
as follows. In section 2, a definition for path exposure is
proposed and a method to evaluate the exposure of a given
path is developed. In section 3, the problem of random 
deployment is formulated and several solutions are presented.
An analytical study of these solutions is given in section 4
and section 5 presents simulation results that are used in
section 6 to determine the optimum solution for a given 
environment. The paper concludes with section 7.
2. PATH EXPOSURE
In this section, a model for sensor network target detection
is proposed, a definition of path exposure is presented and
expressions for evaluating this path exposure are developed.
2.1 Model
Consider a rectangular sensor field with n sensors 
de42
ployed at locations si, i = 1, . . . , n. A target at location
u emits a signal which is measured by the sensors. The 
signal from the target decays as a polynomial of the distance.
If the decay coefficient is k, the signal energy of a target at
location u measured by the sensor at si is given by
Si(u) =
K
||u − si||k
(1)
where K is the energy emitted by the target and ||u − si||
is the geometric distance between the target and the sensor.
Depending on the environment the value k typically ranges
from 2.0 to 5.0 [4].
Energy measurements at a sensor are usually corrupted
by noise. If Ni denotes the noise energy at sensor i during a
particular measurement, then the total energy measured at
sensor i, when the target is at location u, is
Ei(u) = Si(u) + Ni =
K
||u − si||k
+ Ni.
The sensors collaborate to arrive at a consensus decision as
to whether a target is present in the region. We consider two
basic approaches for reaching this consensus: Value fusion
and Decision fusion [3]. In value fusion, one of the sensors
gathers the energy measurements from the other sensors,
totals up the energy and compares the sum to a threshold
to decide whether a target is present. If the sum exceeds
the threshold, then the consensus decision is that a target
is present. In contrast, in decision fusion, each individual
sensor compares its energy measurement to a threshold to
arrive at a local decision as to whether a target is present.
The local decisions (1 for target present and 0 otherwise)
from the sensors are totaled at a sensor and the sum is 
compared to another threshold to arrive at the consensus 
decision. In some situations, value fusion outperforms decision
fusion and vice versa.
2.1.1 Value Fusion.
The probability of consensus target detection when the
target is at location u is
Dv(u) = Prob

where η is the value fusion threshold. If the noise processes
at the sensors are independent, then the probability density
function of n
i=1 Ni equals the convolution of the 
probability density function of Ni, i = 1, . . . , n. In particular, if
the noise process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian
Noise (AWGN), then n
i=1 Ni has a Chi-square distribution
of degree n.
Due to the presence of noise, the sensors may incorrectly
decide that a target is present even though there is no 
target in the field. The probability of a consensus false target
detection is
Fv = Prob
n
i=1
Ni ≥ η . (2)
As above, if the noise processes at the sensors are 
independent and AWGN, then the false alarm probability can be
computed from the Chi-square distribution of degree n.
2.1.2 Decision Fusion.
For decision fusion, the probability of consensus target
detection when the target is located at u is

and
P0 = Prob [hd,i(u) = 0]
= 1 − Prob [hd,i(u) = 1] .
can be computed from Chi-square distribution of degree 1
for AWGN noise process.
The probability of false target detection at sensor i is
Prob[gd,i = 1] = Prob[Ni ≥ η1] and
Prob[gd,i = 0] = 1 − Prob[gd,i = 1].
Therefore, the probability of consensus false target detection
is

The above equations serve as an analytic basis for 
evaluating exposure as defined in the following subsection.
Note that in value and decision fusion the knowledge of the
sensors location can be used to make the detection decision.
For example, a sensor can report values that differ 
substantially from its neighbors values. This discrepancy can be
analyzed to avoid false alarms or misses and therefore 
improve the detection performance. However, such algorithms
are not considered in this paper.
2.2 De£nition of exposure
We define exposure to be the probability of detecting the
target or an intruder carrying out the unauthorized activity,
where the activity depends on the problem under 
consideration. In this paper, the activity considered is the 
Unauthorized Traversal (UT) as defined below.
Unauthorized Traversal (UT) Problem: We are given
a sensor field with n sensors at locations s1, s2, . . . , sn (see
Figure 1). We are also given the stochastic characterization
of the noise at each sensor and a tolerable bound, α, on the
false alarm probability. Let P denote a path from the west to
the east periphery of the sensor field. A target traversing the
sensor field using path P is detected if it is detected at some
point u ∈ P. The exposure of path P is the net probability
of detecting a target that traverses the field using P. The
target is assumed to be able to follow any path through the
field and the problem is to find the path P with the least
exposure.

2.3 Solution to the UT problem
Let P denote a path from the west to the east 
periphery through the sensor field. A target that traverses the
field using P is not detected if and only if it is not detected
at any time while it is on that path. Since detection 
attempts by the sensor network occur at a fixed frequency, we
can associate each detection attempt with a point u ∈ P
when assuming that the target traverses the field at a 
constant speed. The detection attempts are based on energy
measured over a period of time T during which the target
is moving. Therefore, the detection probability associated
with each point u reflects the measurements performed 
during time T. Considering the path, the net probability of not
detecting a target traversing the field using P is the 
product of the probabilities of no detection at each point u ∈ P.
That is, if G(P) denotes the net probability of not detecting
a target as it traverses over path P, then,
log G(P) =
u∈P
log(1 − D(u))du,
where D(u) is either Dv(u) of Dd(u) depending on whether
the sensors use value or decision fusion to arrive at a 
consensus decision. Since the exposure of P is (1 − G(P)), the
problem is to find the path which minimizes (1 − G(P)) or
equivalently the path that minimizes | log G(P)|1
.
In general, the path P that minimizes | log G(P)| can be
fairly arbitrary in shape. The proposed solution does not
exactly compute this path. Instead, we rely on the following
approximation. We first divide the sensor field into a fine
grid and then assume that the target only moves along this
grid. The problem then is to find the path P on this grid
that minimizes | log G(P)|. Note that, the finer the grid the
closer the approximation. Also, one can use higher order
grids such as in [5] instead of the rectangular grid we use
in this paper. The higher order grids change the runtime
of the algorithm but the approach is the same as with the
rectangular grid.
For the target not to be detected at any point u ∈ P,

it need not be detected at any point u lying between any
two adjacent grid points of P. We therefore subdivide any
path P as a chain of grid segments. Let us consider two
adjacent points, say v1 and v2 on the grid. Let l denote
the line segment between v1 and v2. Also, let ml denote
the probability of not detecting a target traveling between
v1 and v2 on the line segment l. Then, from the discussion
above,
log ml =
u∈l
log(1 − D(u))du (3)
The probability ml can be evaluated by finding the detection
probability D(u) at each point u ∈ l. Note that, ml lies
between 0 and 1 and, therefore, log ml is negative.
To find the least exposed path, a non-negative weight
equal to | log ml| is assigned to each segment l on this grid.
Also, a fictitious point a is created and a line segment is
added from a to each grid point on the west periphery of
the sensor field. A weight equal to 0 is assigned to each of
these line segments. Similarly, a fictitious point b is created
and a line segment is added from b to each grid point on
the east periphery of the sensor field. A weight equal to 0
is assigned to each of these line segments.
The problem of finding the least exposed path from west
periphery to east periphery is then equivalent to the problem
of finding the least weight path from a to b on this grid. Such
a path can be efficiently determined using the Dijkstra"s
shortest path algorithm [1]. A pseudo-code of the overall
algorithm is shown in Figure 2.
Example: Figure 3 shows a sensor field with eight sensors
at locations marked by dark circles. Assume the noise 
process at each sensor is Additive White Gaussian with mean
0 and variance 1. Further assume that the sensors use value
fusion to arrive at a consensus decision. Then, from 
Equation 2, we chose a threshold η = 3.0 to achieve a false alarm
probability of 0.187%. The field has been divided into a
10 × 10 grid. The target emits an energy K = 12 and the
energy decay factor is 2. The figure shows the weight 
assigned to each line segment in the grid as described above.
The least exposure path found by the Dijkstra"s algorithm
for this weighted grid is highlighted. The probability of

3. DEPLOYMENT
In this section, the problem of sensor deployment for 
unauthorized traversal detection is formulated and solutions are
identified.
3.1 Problem formulation
Consider a region to be monitored for unauthorized 
traversal using a sensor network. The target to traverse the sensor
field emits a given energy level K and the stochastic of the
noise in the region is known. The sensors are to be deployed
over the region in a random fashion where the sensors 
locations in the region are a priori undetermined and only the
number or density of sensors can be chosen. The problem is
to find a deployment strategy that results in a desired 
performance level in unauthorized traversal monitoring of the
region.
This performance is measured by the false alarm 
probability and the path exposure defined in section 2. The false
alarm probability does not depend on the sensor placement
and is only determined by the number of sensors deployed
and the thresholds used in the detection algorithms. It is 
assumed to be fixed in this study so that the problem consists
of maximizing the exposure at constant false alarm rate.
Since targets can traverse the region through any path, the
goal of deployment is to maximize the exposure of the least
exposed path in the region.
Obviously, the minimum exposure in the region increases
(if false alarm rate is kept constant) as more sensors are
deployed in the region. However, since the deployment is
random, there are no guarantees that the desired exposure
level is achieved for a given number of sensors. Indeed some
sensor placements can result in very poor detection ability,
in particular when the sensors are all deployed in the same
vicinity. A study of the statistical distribution of exposure
for varying sensor placement for a given number of sensors
can provide a confidence level that the desired detection level
is achieved. In practical situations, only a limited number
of sensors are available for deployment and only a limited
detection level with associated confidence level is achievable
at a given false alarm rate.
3.2 Solution
Based on the above discussion, we develop a solution method
to the deployment problem when a maximum of M sensors
can be used. Deploying the M sensors results in the 
maximum achievable detection level but is not optimal when
considering the cost of sensors. To reduce the number of
sensors deployed, only part of the available sensors can be
deployed first and the sensors can then report their position.
The random sensor placement obtained can be analyzed to
determine if it satisfies the desired performance level. If it
does not, additional sensors can be deployed until the 
desired exposure level is reached or until the all M available
sensors are deployed.
The number of sensors used in this strategy can be 
minimized by deploying one sensor at a time. However, a cost is
usually associated with each deployment of sensors and 
deploying one sensor at a time may not be cost effective if the
cost of deployment is sufficiently large with respect to the
cost of single sensors. By assigning a cost to both single 
sensors and deployment, the optimal number of sensors to be
deployed at first and thereafter can be determined. In the
next section, we develop analytical expressions for finding
the optimal solution. In general, the optimal cost solution
is neither deploying one sensor at a time nor deploying all
the sensors at a time.
4. ANALYTICAL SOLUTION
In this section, we derive an analytical model for the cost
of deployment. Let ed be the desired minimum exposure for
the sensor network to be deployed when a maximum of M
sensors are available for deployment. The position of sensors
are random in the region of interest R and for a given

ber of sensors n, the least exposure e is a random variable.
Let Fn(x) denote the cumulative distribution function of e,
that is the probability that e is less than x, when n sensors
are deployed.
As mentioned in the previous section, there is no a priori
guarantee that the exposure ed will be obtained when 
deploying the sensors. If M is the maximum number of sensors
available, the confidence of obtaining a least exposure of ed
or more is 1−FM (ed). For the proposed solution, we assume
that the position of the sensors obtained after a deployment
is known so that additional sensors can be deployed if the
minimum exposure ed is not reached. To evaluate the 
probability that the exposure ed is reached after additional sensor
deployment, we make the following approximation: the 
distribution of exposure for n sensors is independent of the 
exposure corresponding to k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1.
This is an approximation since the exposure obtained with
n sensors is always higher than the exposure obtained with
only k of these n sensors, 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. We observed
that the re-deployment of just a few sensors can 
substantially modify the coverage of the region, for example when
filling empty spaces. The approximation is also justified by
the loose relation between exposure and sensors positions.
Indeed, a given minimum exposure can correspond to many
different deployment positions, some of which can be easily
improved by deploying a few additional sensors (e.g. when
there is a empty space in the region coverage), some of which
can only be improved by deploying many additional sensors
(e.g. when the sensors are evenly distributed on the region).
As the minimum exposure e is a random variable, the cost
of deploying the sensors in steps until the desired exposure
is reached is also a random variable C. We now derive the
expression for the expected value of C. Let ni be the total
number of sensors deployed after each step i for a maximum
number of steps S so that nS = M. Note that ni − ni−1
is the number of sensors deployed at step i. Also let Cd be
the cost of deploying the sensors at each step and Cs be the
cost of each sensor. If the desired exposure is obtained after
the first step, the cost of deployment is Cd + n1Cs, and this

step even when the desired exposure is not obtained.
5. SIMULATION
In this section, we present results of simulations that were
conducted to collect the exposure distribution function of
the number of sensors deployed.
5.1 Method
The exposure distribution is obtained by collecting 
statistics on the exposure when deploying sensors randomly in a
predefined region. The random deployment is assumed to
be uniformly distributed over the region, which is a local 
approximation. For every deployment, the minimum exposure
is found using a simulator implementing the algorithm 
presented in section 2. A decay factor of k = 2 and maximum
energy of K = 60 are chosen to model the energy emitted
by targets (cf Equation 1). The region monitored is of size
20×20 with a noise (AWGN) of variance 1, so that the signal
coming from the target is covered by noise when the target is
8 or more units length away from a sensor. The sensors use
value fusion to collaborate when making a common decision
on the presence of a target in the region. The threshold for
detection is chosen as a function of the number of sensors
to give a constant false alarm probability. The false alarm
probability for each detection attempt is chosen so that the
probability to get one or more false alarm along a path of
length 20 units (corresponding to 20 detection attempts by
the sensors) is 5%.

5.2 Distribution of minimum exposure
The distribution of minimum exposure were found for the
number of sensor deployed varying from 1 to 40. To 
illustrate our results, the probability density functions for 5, 10
and 15 sensors are shown in Figure 4.
We observe that for 5 sensors deployed, the minimum 
exposure has zero density for values less than the false alarm
probability of .04. The highest density is obtained for 
values around .07 and then drops exponentially towards zero
for higher values of exposure. For deployment of 10 sensors,
we find again that the minimum exposure has zero density
for values below .04, then increases and has about constant
density for values lying between .1 and .98. We also observe
a peak of density around 1. For deployment of 15 sensors,
densities start at zero for small values and remain very small
for most values of minimum exposure. The density slowly
increases and has a large peak for minimum exposure of 1.
As expected, the minimum exposure increases on average
as the number of sensors deployed increases. When 
randomly deploying 5 sensors, it is very unlikely to obtain a
placement providing a desirable minimum exposure. When
deploying 10 sensors, most of the exposure levels are equally
likely and only poor confidence is given to obtain a 
desirable exposure level. When deploying 15 sensors, it is very
likely that the sensor placement will give good exposure and
this likelihood keeps increasing with the number of sensors
deployed.
We use the cumulative distribution function obtained from
the statistics collected to evaluate the likelihood that the 
desired level of exposure ed is obtained for varying number of
sensors. The graph of Figure 5 shows the probability that
the minimum exposure is above ed as a function of the 
number of sensors deployed for ed = 80%, 85%, 90% and 95%.
These values can be used to evaluate the cost expressed in
Equation 4. The graph shows that the confidence level to
obtain a given minimum exposure level ed increases with the
number of sensors deployed. The confidence for ed when 
deploying 40 sensors is above .999, which is sufficient for most
applications, and therefore we did not evaluate the 
distribution of exposure when deploying more than 40 sensors.
6. RESULTS
In this section, we evaluate the expected cost of deploying
sensors using the simulation results. The optimal number
of sensor to deploy at first and in the succeeding steps can
be derived from these results.
For this cost analysis, the region parameters and signal
model are the same as specified in section 5. We further
assume that the number of sensors deployed at every step
is constant so that ni − ni−1 = n for all 1 ≤ i ≤ S. In this
case, Equation 4 reduces to
E{C} = (Cd + n.Cs)

We evaluated the expected cost as a function of n for
three different cost assignments with a desired exposure of
ed = 95%. The three corresponding graphs are shown in
Figure 6. The first cost assignment is (Cd = 0, Cs = 1) so
that the expected cost is the expected number of sensors to
be used to achieve an exposure of 95%. Since Cd = 0, the
number of steps used to deploy the sensors doesn"t affect the
cost and it is therefore optimal to deploy one sensor at a time
until the minimum exposure ed is reached, as we observe on
the graph. Overall, the expected number of sensor to be
47
deployed increases with n but we observe a local minimum
for n = 16 that can be explained by the following analysis.
The expected number of sensors is a weighted sum of i.n, 1 ≤
i ≤ S that are the different number of sensors than can
be deployed at a time when deploying n sensors at each
step. For n around 16, the probability that the minimum
exposure is above ed varies a lot as shown in Figure 5 and the
weight associated with the first term of the sum (n) increases
rapidly while the weights associated with higher number of
sensors decrease. This is the cause of the local minimum
and the cost starts to increase again when the increase in n
compensates for the decrease in weights.
The second cost assignment is (Cd = 5, Cs = 1) so that
the cost of a deployment is equal to the cost of five sensors
(note that only the relative cost of Cd/Cs determines the
shape of the graphs). In this case, deploying one sensor at a
time is prohibited by the cost of deployment and the optimal
number of sensors to deploy at every step is 19. Again, we
find that the curve presents a local minimum for n = 9 that
is due to the variations in weights. The last cost assignment
is (Cd = 100, Cs = 1) and the minimum cost is achieved
when deploying 27 sensors at every step.
These results are specific to the region and the parameters
characterizing the signal emitted by the target that were
chosen for the simulation. Similar results can be derived for
other parameters, most of the effort residing in finding the
exposure distributions through simulation.
7. CONCLUSION
This paper addresses the problem of sensor deployment
in a region to be monitored for target intrusion. A 
mechanism for sensor collaboration to perform target detection
is proposed and analyzed to evaluate the exposure of paths
through the region. The minimum exposure is used as a
measure of the goodness of deployment, the goal being to
maximize the exposure of the least exposed path in the 
region.
In the case where sensors are randomly placed in a region
to be monitored, a mechanism for sequential deployment in
steps is developed. The strategy consists of deploying a 
limited number of sensors at a time until the desired minimum
exposure is achieved. The cost function used in this study
depends on the number of sensors deployed in each step and
the cost of each deployment. Through simulation, the 
distribution of minimum exposure obtained by random 
deployment was evaluated for varying number of sensors deployed.
These results were used to evaluate the cost of deployment
for varying number of sensors deployed in each step.
We found that the optimal number of sensors deployed in
each step varies with the relative cost assigned to 
deployment and sensors. The results of this study can be extended
to larger regions with different target parameters. The 
solution proposed in this paper can also be improved by 
considering deploying variable number of sensors at each step
and this multiple variables problem requires further 
investigation.
