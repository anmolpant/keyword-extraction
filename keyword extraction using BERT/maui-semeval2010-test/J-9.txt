ABSTRACT
According to economic theory-supported by empirical and
laboratory evidence-the equilibrium price of a financial 
security reflects all of the information regarding the security"s
value. We investigate the computational process on the path
toward equilibrium, where information distributed among
traders is revealed step-by-step over time and incorporated
into the market price. We develop a simplified model of an
information market, along with trading strategies, in order
to formalize the computational properties of the process.
We show that securities whose payoffs cannot be expressed
as weighted threshold functions of distributed input bits are
not guaranteed to converge to the proper equilibrium 
predicted by economic theory. On the other hand, securities
whose payoffs are threshold functions are guaranteed to 
converge, for all prior probability distributions. Moreover, these
threshold securities converge in at most n rounds, where n
is the number of bits of distributed information. We also
prove a lower bound, showing a type of threshold security
that requires at least n/2 rounds to converge in the worst
case.

1. INTRODUCTION
The strong form of the efficient markets hypothesis states
that market prices nearly instantly incorporate all 
information available to all traders. As a result, market prices 
encode the best forecasts of future outcomes given all 
information, even if that information is distributed across many
sources. Supporting evidence can be found in empirical
studies of options markets [14], political stock markets [7, 8,
22], sports betting markets [3, 9, 27], horse-racing markets
[30], market games [23, 24], and laboratory investigations of
experimental markets [6, 25, 26].
The process of information incorporation is, at its essence,
a distributed computation. Each trader begins with his or
her own information. As trades are made, summary 
information is revealed through market prices. Traders learn or
infer what information others are likely to have by observing
prices, then update their own beliefs based on their 
observations. Over time, if the process works as advertised, all
information is revealed, and all traders converge to the same
information state. At this point, the market is in what is
called a rational expectations equilibrium [11, 16, 19]. All
information available to all traders is now reflected in the
going prices, and no further trades are desirable until some
new information becomes available.
While most markets are not designed with information 
aggregation as a primary motivation-for example, derivatives
156
markets are intended mainly for risk management and sports
betting markets for entertainment-recently, some markets
have been created solely for the purpose of aggregating 
information on a topic of interest. The Iowa Electronic 
Market1
is a prime example, operated by the University of Iowa
Tippie College of Business for the purpose of investigating
how information about political elections distributed among
traders gets reflected in securities prices whose payoffs are
tied to actual election outcomes [7, 8].
In this paper, we investigate the nature of the 
computational process whereby distributed information is revealed
and combined over time into the prices in information 
markets. To do so, in Section 3, we propose a model of an 
information market that is tractable for theoretical analysis and,
we believe, captures much of the important essence of real
information markets. In Section 4, we present our main 
theoretical results concerning this model. We prove that only
Boolean securities whose payoffs can be expressed as 
threshold functions of the distributed input bits of information are
guaranteed to converge as predicted by rational expectations
theory. Boolean securities with more complex payoffs may
not converge under some prior distributions. We also 
provide upper and lower bounds on the convergence time for
these threshold securities. We show that, for all prior 
distributions, the price of a threshold security converges to its
rational expectations equilibrium price in at most n rounds,
where n is the number of bits of distributed information. We
show that this worst-case bound is tight within a factor of
two by illustrating a situation in which a threshold security
requires n/2 rounds to converge.
2. RELATIONSHIP TO RELATED WORK
As mentioned, there is a great deal of documented 
evidence supporting the notion that markets are able to 
aggregate information in a number of scenarios using a variety
of market mechanisms. The theoretically ideal mechanism
requires what is called a complete market. A complete 
market contains enough linearly independent securities to span
the entire state space of interest [1, 31]. That is, the 
dimensionality of the available securities equals the dimensionality
of the event space over which information is to be 
aggregated.2
In this ideal case, all private information becomes
common knowledge in equilibrium, and thus any function
of the private information can be directly evaluated by any
agent or observer. However, this theoretical ideal is almost
never achievable in practice, because it generally requires a
number of securities exponential in the number of random
variables of interest.
When available securities form an incomplete market [17]
in relation to the desired information space-as is usually
the case-aggregation may be partial. Not all private 
information is revealed in equilibrium, and prices may not
convey enough information to recover the complete joint
probability distribution over all events. Still, it is generally
assumed that aggregation does occur along the dimensions
represented in the market; that is, prices do reflect a 
consistent projection of the entire joint distribution onto the
smaller-dimensional space spanned by securities. In this

When we refer to independence or dimensionality of 
securities, we mean the independence or dimensionality of the
random variables on which the security payoffs are based.
per, we investigate cases in which even this partial 
aggregation fails. For example, even though there is enough private
information to determine completely the price of a security
in the market, the equilibrium price may in fact reveal no
information at all! So characterizations of when a rational
expectations equilibrium is fully revealing do not 
immediately apply to our problem. We are not asking whether all
possible functions of private information can be evaluated,
but whether a particular target function can be evaluated.
We show that properties of the function itself play a major
role, not just the relative dimensionalities of the information
and security spaces.
Our second main contribution is examining the dynamics
of information aggregation before equilibrium, in particular
proving upper and lower bounds on the time to convergence
in those cases in which aggregation succeeds.
Shoham and Tennenholtz [29] define a rationally 
computable function as a function of agents" valuations (types)
that can be computed by a market, assuming agents follow
rational equilibrium strategies. The authors mainly consider
auctions of goods as their basic mechanistic unit and 
examine the communication complexity involved in computing
various functions of agents" valuations of goods. For 
example, they give auction mechanisms that can compute the
maximum, minimum, and kth-highest of the agents" 
valuations of a single good using 1, 1, and n − k + 1 bits of 
communication, respectively. They also examine the potential
tradeoff between communication complexity and revenue.
3. MODEL OF AN INFORMATION 
MARKET
To investigate the properties and limitations of the 
process whereby an information market converges toward its
rational-expectations equilibrium, we formulate a 
representative model of the market. In designing the model, our
goals were two-fold: (1) to make the model rich enough to
be realistic and (2) to make the model simple enough to
admit meaningful analysis. Any modeling decisions must
trade off these two generally conflicting goals, and the 
decision process is as much an art as a science. Nonetheless,
we believe that our model captures enough of the essence
of real information markets to lend credence to the results
that follow. In this section, we present our modeling 
assumptions and justifications in detail. Section 3.1 describes
the initial information state of the system, Section 3.2 covers
the market mechanism, and Section 3.3 presents the agents"
strategies.
3.1 Initial information state
There are n agents (traders) in the system, each of whom
is privy to one bit of information, denoted xi. The 
vector of all n bits is denoted x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn). In the
initial state, each agent is aware only of her own bit of 
information. All agents have a common prior regarding the
joint distribution of bits among agents, but none has any
specific information about the actual value of bits held by
others. Note that this common-prior assumption-typical
in the economics literature-does not imply that all agents
agree. To the contrary, because each agent has different
information, the initial state of the system is in general a
state of disagreement. Nearly any disagreement that could
be modeled by assuming different priors can instead be 
mod157
eled by assuming a common prior with different information,
and so the common-prior assumption is not as severe as it
may seem.
3.2 Market mechanism
The security being traded by the agents is a financial 
instrument whose payoff is a function f(x) of the agents" bits.
The form of f (the description of the security) is common
knowledge3
among agents. We sometimes refer to the xi as
the input bits. At some time in the future after trading is
completed, the true value of f(x) is revealed,4
and every
owner of the security is paid an amount f(x) in cash per
unit owned. If an agent ends with a negative quantity of
the security (by selling short), then the agent must pay the
amount f(x) in cash per unit. Note that if someone were
to have complete knowledge of all input bits x, then that
person would know the true value f(x) of the security with
certainty, and so would be willing to buy it at any price
lower than f(x) and (short) sell it at any price higher than
f(x).5
Following Dubey, Geanakoplos, and Shubik [4], and 
Jackson and Peck [13], we model the market-price formation
process as a multiperiod Shapley-Shubik market game [28].
The Shapley-Shubik process operates as follows: The 
market proceeds in synchronous rounds. In each round, each
agent i submits a bid bi and a quantity qi. The semantics
are that agent i is supplying a quantity qi of the security and
an amount bi of money to be traded in the market. For 
simplicity, we assume that there are no restrictions on credit
or short sales, and so an agent"s trade is not constrained
by her possessions. The market clears in each round by
settling at a single price that balances the trade in that
round: The clearing price is p = i bi/ i qi. At the end
of the round, agent i holds a quantity qi proportional to the
money she bid: qi = bi/p. In addition, she is left with an
amount of money bi that reflects her net trade at price p:
bi = bi − p(qi − qi) = pqi. Note that agent i"s net trade in
the security is a purchase if p < bi/qi and a sale if p > bi/qi.
After each round, the clearing price p is publicly revealed.
Agents then revise their beliefs according to any information
garnered from the new price. The next round proceeds as
the previous. The process continues until an equilibrium is
reached, meaning that prices and bids do not change from
one round to the next.
In this paper, we make a further simplifying restriction
on the trading in each round: We assume that qi = 1 for
each agent i. This modeling assumption serves two 
analytical purposes. First, it ensures that there is forced trade in
every round. Classic results in economics show that 
perfectly rational and risk-neutral agents will never trade with
each other for purely speculative reasons (even if they have
differing information) [20]. There are many factors that can
induce rational agents to trade, such as differing degrees of
risk aversion, the presence of other traders who are trading
for liquidity reasons rather than speculative gain, or a 
market maker who is pumping money into the market through a
subsidy. We sidestep this issue by simply assuming that the
3
Common knowledge is information that all agents know,
that all agents know that all agents know, and so on ad
infinitum [5].
4
The values of the input bits themselves may or may not be
publicly revealed.

Throughout this paper we ignore the time value of money.
informed agents will trade (for unspecified reasons). 
Second, forcing qi = 1 for all i means that the total volume
of trade and the impact of any one trader on the clearing
price are common knowledge; the clearing price p is a simple
function of the agents" bids, p = i bi/n. We will discuss
the implications of alternative market models in Section 5.
3.3 Agent strategies
In order to draw formal conclusions about the price 
evolution process, we need to make some assumptions about how
agents behave. Essentially we assume that agents are 
riskneutral, myopic,6
and bid truthfully: Each agent in each
round bids his or her current valuation of the security, which
is that agent"s estimation of the expected payoff of the 
security. Expectations are computed according to each agent"s
probability distribution, which is updated via Bayes" rule
when new information (revealed via the clearing prices) 
becomes available. We also assume that it is common 
knowledge that all the agents behave in the specified manner.
Would rational agents actually behave according to this
strategy? It"s hard to say. Certainly, we do not claim that
this is an equilibrium strategy in the game-theoretic sense.
Furthermore, it is clear that we are ignoring some 
legitimate tactics, e.g., bidding falsely in one round in order to
effect other agents" judgments in the following rounds 
(nonmyopic reasoning). However, we believe that the strategy
outlined is a reasonable starting point for analysis. Solving
for a true game-theoretic equilibrium strategy in this setting
seems extremely difficult. Our assumptions seem 
reasonable when there are enough agents in the system such that
extremely complex meta-reasoning is not likely to improve
upon simply bidding one"s true expected value. In this case,
according the the Shapley-Shubik mechanism, if the 
clearing price is below an agent"s expected value that agent will
end up buying (increasing expected profit); otherwise, if the
clearing price is above the agent"s expected value, the agent
will end up selling (also increasing expected profit).
4. COMPUTATIONAL PROPERTIES
In this section, we study the computational power of 
information markets for a very simple class of aggregation 
functions: Boolean functions of n variables. We characterize the
set of Boolean functions that can be computed in our market
model for all prior distributions and then prove upper and
lower bounds on the worst-case convergence time for these
markets.
The information structure we assume is as follows: There
are n agents, and each agent i has a single bit of private 
information xi. We use x to denote the vector (x1, . . . , xn) of
inputs. All the agents also have a common prior probability
distribution P : {0, 1}n
→ [0, 1] over the values of x. We
define a Boolean aggregate function f(x) : {0, 1}n
→ {0, 1}
that we would like the market to compute. Note that x, and
hence f(x), is completely determined by the combination of
all the agents" information, but it is not known to any one
agent. The agents trade in a Boolean security F, which
pays off $1 if f(x) = 1 and $0 if f(x) = 0. So an omniscient
6
Risk neutrality implies that each agent"s utility for the 
security is linearly related to his or her subjective estimation of
the expected payoff of the security. Myopic behavior means
that agents treat each round as if it were the final round:
They do not reason about how their bids may affect the bids
of other agents in future rounds.
158
agent with access to all the agents" bits would know the true
value of security F-either exactly $1 or exactly $0. In 
reality, risk-neutral agents with limited information will value
F according to their expectation of its payoff, or Ei[f(x)],
where Ei is the expectation operator applied according to
agent i"s probability distribution.
For any function f, trading in F may happen to converge
to the true value of f(x) by coincidence if the prior 
probability distribution is sufficiently degenerate. More 
interestingly, we would like to know for which functions f does the
price of the security F always converge to f(x) for all prior
probability distributions P.7
In Section 4.2, we prove a 
necessary and sufficient condition that guarantees convergence.
In Section 4.3, we address the natural follow-up question,
by deriving upper and lower bounds on the worst-case 
number of rounds of trading required for the value of f(x) to be
revealed.
4.1 Equilibrium price characterization
Our analysis builds on a characterization of the 
equilibrium price of F that follows from a powerful result on 
common knowledge of aggregates due to McKelvey and Page [19],
later extended by Nielsen et al. [21].
Information markets aim to aggregate the knowledge of
all the agents. Procedurally, this occurs because the agents
learn from the markets: The price of the security conveys
information to each agent about the knowledge of other
agents. We can model the flow of information through prices
as follows.
Let Ω = {0, 1}n
be the set of possible values of x; we say
that Ω denotes the set of possible states of the world. The
prior P defines everyone"s initial belief about the likelihood
of each state. As trading proceeds, some possible states can
be logically ruled out, but the relative likelihoods among the
remaining states are fully determined by the prior P. So the
common knowledge after any stage is completely described
by the set of states that an external observer-with no 
information beyond the sequence of prices observed-considers
possible (along with the prior). Similarly, the knowledge of
agent i at any point is also completely described by the set
of states she considers possible. We use the notation Sr
to
denote the common-knowledge possibility set after round r,
and Sr
i to denote the set of states that agent i considers
possible after round r.
Initially, the only common knowledge is that the input
vector x is in Ω; in other words, the set of states considered
possible by an external observer before trading has occurred
is the set S0
= Ω. However, each agent i also knows the
value of her bit xi; thus, her knowledge set S0
i is the set
{y ∈ Ω|yi = xi}. Agent i"s first-round bid is her conditional
expectation of the event f(x) = 1 given that x ∈ S0
i . All
the agents" bids are processed, and the clearing price p1
is
announced. An external observer could predict agent i"s bid
if he knew the value of xi. Thus, if he knew the value of
x, he could predict the value of p1
. In other words, the
external observer knows the function price1
(x) that relates
the first round price to the true state x. Of course, he does
not know the value of x; however, he can rule out any vector
x that would have resulted in a different clearing price from
the observed price p1
.
7
We assume that the common prior is consistent with x in
the sense that it assigns a non-zero probability to the actual
value of x.
Thus, the common knowledge after round 1 is the set
S1
= {y ∈ S0
| price1
(y) = p1
}. Agent i knows the 
common knowledge and, in addition, knows the value of bit xi.
Hence, after every round r, the knowledge of agent i is given
by Sr
i = {y ∈ Sr
|yi = xi}. Note that, because knowledge
can only improve over time, we must always have Sr
i ⊆ Sr−1
i
and Sr
⊆ Sr−1
. Thus, only a finite number of changes
in each agent"s knowledge are possible, and so eventually
we must converge to an equilibrium after which no player
learns any further information. We use S∞
to denote the
common knowledge at this point, and S∞
i to denote agent
i"s knowledge at this point. Let p∞
denote the clearing price
at equilibrium.
Informally, McKelvey and Page [19] show that, if n 
people with common priors but different information about the
likelihood of some event A agree about a suitable 
aggregate of their individual conditional probabilities, then their
individual conditional probabilities of event A"s occurring
must be identical. (The precise definition of suitable is
described below.) There is a strong connection to rational
expectation equilibria in markets, which was noted in the
original McKelvey-Page paper: The market price of a 
security is common knowledge at the point of equilibrium. Thus,
if the price is a suitable aggregate of the conditional 
expectations of all the agents, then in equilibrium they must
have identical conditional expectations of the event that the
security will pay off. (Note that their information may still
be different.)
Definition 1. A function g : n
→ is called 
stochastically monotone if it can be written in the form g(x) =
i gi(xi), where each function gi : → is strictly 
increasing.
Bergin and Brandenburger [2] proved that this simple 
definition of stochastically monotone functions is equivalent to
the original definition in McKelvey-Page [19].
Definition 2. A function g : n
→ is called 
stochastically regular if it can be written in the form g = h ◦ g ,
where g is stochastically monotone and h is invertible on
the range of g .
We can now state the McKelvey-Page result, as generalized
by Nielsen et al. [21]. In our context, the following simple
theorem statement suffices; more general versions of this
theorem can be found in [19, 21].
Theorem 1. (Nielsen et al. [21]) Suppose that, at 
equilibrium, the n agents have a common prior, but possibly 
different information, about the value of a random variable F,
as described above. For all i, let p∞
i = E(F|x ∈ S∞
i ). If g
is a stochastically regular function and g(p∞
1 , p∞
2 , . . . , p∞
n ) is
common knowledge, then it must be the case that
p∞
1 = p∞
2 = · · · = p∞
n = E(F|x ∈ S∞
) = p∞
In one round of our simplified Shapley-Shubik trading
model, the announced price is the mean of the conditional
expectations of the n agents. The mean is a stochastically
regular function; hence, Theorem 1 shows that, at 
equilibrium, all agents have identical conditional expectations of
the payoff of the security. It follows that the equilibrium
159
price p∞
must be exactly the conditional expectations of all
agents at equilibrium.
Theorem 1 does not in itself say how the equilibrium is
reached. McKelvey and Page, extending an argument due
to Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis [10], show that repeated
announcement of the aggregate will eventually result in 
common knowledge of the aggregate. In our context, this is
achieved by announcing the current price at the end of each
round; this will ultimately converge to a state in which all
agents bid the same price p∞
.
However, reaching an equilibrium price is not sufficient for
the purposes of information aggregation. We also want the
price to reveal the actual value of f(x). It is possible that
the equilibrium price p∞
of the security F will not be either
0 or 1, and so we cannot infer the value of f(x) from it.
Example 1: Consider two agents 1 and 2 with private input
bits x1 and x2 respectively. Suppose the prior probability
distribution is uniform, i.e., x = (x1, x2) takes the values
(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), and (1, 1) each with probability 1
4
. Now,
suppose the aggregate function we want to compute is the
XOR function, f(x) = x1 ⊕ x2. To this end, we design a
market to trade in a Boolean security F, which will 
eventually payoff $1 iff x1 ⊕ x2 = 1.
If agent 1 observes x1 = 1, she estimates the expected
value of F to be the probability that x2 = 0 (given x1 = 1),
which is 1
2
. If she observes x1 = 0, her expectation of the
value of F is the conditional probability that x2 = 1, which
is also 1
2
. Thus, in either case, agent 1 will bid 0.5 for F
in the first round. Similarly, agent 2 will also always bid
0.5 in the first round. Hence, the first round of trading
ends with a clearing price of 0.5. From this, agent 2 can
infer that agent 1 bid 0.5, but this gives her no information
about the value of x1-it is still equally likely to be 0 or
1. Agent 1 also gains no information from the first round
of trading, and hence neither agent changes her bid in the
following rounds. Thus, the market reaches equilibrium at
this point. As predicted by Theorem 1, both agents have the
same conditional expectation (0.5) at equilibrium. However,
the equilibrium price of the security F does not reveal the
value of f(x1, x2), even though the combination of agents"
information is enough to determine it precisely.
4.2 Characterizing computable aggregates
We now give a necessary and sufficient characterization of
the class of functions f such that, for any prior distribution
on x, the equilibrium price of F will reveal the true value
of f. We show that this is exactly the class of weighted
threshold functions:
Definition 3. A function f : {0, 1}n
→ {0, 1} is a 
weighted threshold function iff there are real constants w1, w2,
. . . , wn such that
f(x) = 1 iff
n
i=1
wixi ≥ 1
Theorem 2. If f is a weighted threshold function, then,
for any prior probability distribution P, the equilibrium price
of F is equal to f(x).
Proof:
Let S∞
i denote the possibility set of agent i at equilibrium.
As before, we use p∞
to denote the final trading price at
this point. Note that, by Theorem 1, p∞
is exactly agent i"s
conditional expectation of the value of f(x), given her final
possibility set S∞
i .
First, observe that if p∞
is 0 or 1, then we must have
f(x) = p∞
, regardless of the form of f. For instance, if
p∞
= 1, this means that E(f(y)|y ∈ S∞
) = 1. As f(·)
can only take the values 0 or 1, it follows that P(f(y) =
1|y ∈ S∞
) = 1. The actual value x is always in the final
possibility set S∞
, and, furthermore, it must have non-zero
prior probability, because it actually occurred. Hence, it
follows that f(x) = 1 in this case. An identical argument
shows that if p∞
= 0, f(x) = 0.
Hence, it is enough to show that, if f is a weighted 
threshold function, then p∞
is either 0 or 1. We prove this by 
contradiction. Let f(·) be a weighted threshold function 
corresponding to weights {wi}, and assume that 0 < p∞
< 1. By
Theorem 1, we must have:
P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞
) = p∞
(1)
∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞
i ) = p∞
(2)
Recall that S∞
i = {y ∈ S∞
|yi = xi}. Thus, Equation (2)
can be written as
∀i P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞
, yi = xi) = p∞
(3)
Now define
J+
i = P(yi = 1|y ∈ S∞
, f(y) = 1)
J−

, f(y) = 0)

Because by assumption p∞
= 0, 1, both J+

well-defined (for all i): Neither is conditioned on a

Claim: Eqs. 1 and 3 imply that J+
i = J−
i , for all i.
Proof of claim: We consider the two cases xi = 1 and
xi = 0 separately.
Case (i): xi = 1. We can assume that J−
i and J+
i are not
both 0 (or else, the claim is trivially true). In this case, we
have
P(f(y) = 1|y ∈ S∞

Case (ii): xi = 0. When xi = 0, observe that the argument
of Case (i) can be used to prove that (1 − J+
i ) = (1 − J−
i ).
It immediately follows that J+
i = J−
i as well. 2
Hence, we must also have J+
= J−
. But using linearity
of expectation, we can also write J+
as
J+

n
i=1
wiyi y ∈ S∞
, f(y) = 1 ,
160
and, because f(y) = 1 only when i wiyi ≥ 1, this gives us
J+
≥ 1. Similarly,
J−
= E
n
i=1
wiyi y ∈ S∞
, f(y) = 0 ,
and thus J−
< 1. This implies J−
= J+
, which leads to a
contradiction. 2
Perhaps surprisingly, the converse of Theorem 2 also holds:
Theorem 3. Suppose f : {0, 1}n
→ {0, 1} cannot be 
expressed as a weighted threshold function. Then there exists
a prior distribution P for which the price of the security F
does not converge to the value of f(x).
Proof: We start from a geometric characterization of 
weighted threshold functions. Consider the Boolean hypercube
{0, 1}n
as a set of points in n
. It is well known that f
is expressible as a weighted threshold function iff there is a
hyperplane in n
that separates all the points at which f
has value 0 from all the points at which f has value 1.
Now, consider the sets
H+
= Conv(f−1
(1))
and
H−
= Conv(f−1
(0)),
where Conv(S) denotes the convex hull of S in n
. H+
and
H−
are convex sets in n
, and so, if they do not intersect, we
can find a separating hyperlane between them. This means
that, if f is not expressible as a weighted threshold function,
H+
and H−
must intersect. In this case, we show how to
construct a prior P for which f(x) is not computed by the
market.
Let x∗
∈ n
be a point in H+
∩ H−
. Because x∗
is in
H+
, there exists some points z1
, z2
, . . . , zm
and constants
λ1, λ2, . . . , λm, such that the following constraints are 
satisfied:
∀k zk
∈ {0, 1}n
, and f(zk
) = 1
∀k 0 < λk ≤ 1
m
k=1
λk = 1
m
k=1
λkzk
= x∗
Similarly, because x∗
∈ H−
, there are points y1
, y2
, . . . , yl
and constants µ1, µ2, . . . , µl, such that
∀j yj
∈ {0, 1}n
, and f(yj
) = 0
∀j 0 < µj ≤ 1
l
j=1
µj = 1
l
j=1
µj yj
= x∗
We now define our prior distribution P as follows:
P(zk
) =
λk
2
for k = 1, 2, . . . , m
P(yj
) =
µj
2
for j = 1, 2, . . . , l,
and all other points are assigned probability 0. It is easy to
see that this is a valid probability distribution. Under this
distribution P, first observe that P(f(x) = 1) = 1
2
. Further,
for any i such that 0 < x∗
i < 1, we have
P(f(x) = 1|xi = 1) =
P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 1)
P(xi = 1)
=
x∗
i
2
x∗
i
=
1
2
and
P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) =
P(f(x) = 1 ∧ xi = 0)
P(xi = 0)
=
(1−x∗
i )
2
(1 − x∗
i )
=
1
2
For indices i such that x∗
i is 0 or 1 exactly, i"s private 
information reveals no additional information under prior P,
and so here too we have P(f(x) = 1|xi = 0) = P(f(x) =
1|xi = 1) = 1
2
.
Hence, regardless of her private bit xi, each agent i will
bid 0.5 for security F in the first round. The clearing price
of 0.5 also reveals no additional information, and so this is
an equilibrium with price p∞
= 0.5 that does not reveal the
value of f(x). 2
The XOR function is one example of a function that 
cannot be expressed as weighted threshold function; Example 1
illustrates Theorem 3 for this function.
4.3 Convergence time bounds
We have shown that the class of Boolean functions 
computable in our model is the class of weighted threshold 
functions. The next natural question to ask is: How many
rounds of trading are necessary before the equilibrium is
reached? We analyze this problem using the same 
simplified Shapley-Shubik model of market clearing in each round.
We first prove that, in the worst case, at most n rounds are
required.
The idea of the proof is to consider the sequence of 
common knowledge sets Ω = S0
, S1
, . . ., and show that, until
the market reaches equilibrium, each set has a strictly lower
dimension than the previous set.
Definition 4. For a set S ⊆ {0, 1}n
, the dimension of
set S is the dimension of the smallest linear subspace of n
that contains all the points in S; we use the notation dim(S)
to denote it.
Lemma 1. If Sr
= Sr−1
, then dim(Sr
) < dim(Sr−1
).
Proof: Let k = dim(Sr−1
). Consider the bids in round r.
In our model, agent i will bid her current expectation for
the value of F,
br
i = E(f(y) = 1|y ∈ Sr−1
, yi = xi).
Thus, depending on the value of xi, br
i will take on one of
two values h
(0)
i or h
(1)
i . Note that h
(0)
i and h
(1)
i depend only
on the set Sr−1
, which is common knowledge before round
161
r. Setting di = h
(1)
i − h
(0)
i , we can write br
i = h
(0)
i + dixi. It
follows that the clearing price in round r is given by
pr
=
1
n
n
i=1
(h
(0)
i + dixi) (4)
All the agents already know all the h
(0)
i and di values, and
they observe the price pr
at the end of the rth round. Thus,
they effectively have a linear equation in x1, x2, . . . , xn that
they use to improve their knowledge by ruling out any 
possibility that would not have resulted in price pr
. In other
words, after r rounds, the common knowledge set Sr
is the
intersection of Sr−1
with the hyperplane defined by 
Equation (4).
It follows that Sr
is contained in the intersection of this
hyperplane with the k-dimension linear space containing
Sr−1
. If Sr
is not equal to Sr−1
, this intersection defines a
linear subspace of dimension (k − 1) that contains Sr
, and
hence Sr
has dimension at most (k − 1). 2
Theorem 4. Let f be a weighted threshold function, and
let P be an arbitrary prior probability distribution. Then,
after at most n rounds of trading, the price reaches its 
equilibrium value p∞
= f(x).
Proof: Consider the sequence of common knowledge sets
S0
, S1
, . . ., and let r be the minimum index such that Sr
=
Sr−1
. Then, the rth round of trading does not improve any
agent"s knowledge, and thus we must have S∞
= Sr−1
and
p∞
= pr−1
. Observing that dim(S0
) = n, and applying
Lemma 1 to the first r − 1 rounds, we must have (r − 1) ≤
n. Thus, the price reaches its equilibrium value within n
rounds. 2
Theorem 4 provides an upper bound of O(n) on the 
number of rounds required for convergence. We now show that
this bound is tight to within a factor of 2 by constructing a
threshold function with 2n inputs and a prior distribution
for which it takes n rounds to determine the value of f(x)
in the worst case.
The functions we use are the carry-bit functions. The
function Cn takes 2n inputs; for convenience, we write the
inputs as x1, x2 . . . , xn, y1, y2, . . . , yn or as a pair (x, y). The
function value is the value of the high-order carry bit when
the binary numbers xnxn−1 · · · x1 and ynyn−1 · · · y1 are 
added together. In weighted threshold form, this can be written
as
Cn(x, y) = 1 iff
n
i=1
xi + yi
2n+1−i
≥ 1.
For this proof, let us call the agents A1, A2, . . . , An, B1, B2,
. . . , Bn, where Ai holds input bit xi, and Bi holds input bit
yi.
We first illustrate our technique by proving that 
computing C2 requires 2 rounds in the worst case. To do this, we
construct a common prior P2 as follows:
• The pair (x1, y1) takes on the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0),
(1, 1) uniformly (i.e., with probability 1
4
each).
• We extend this to a distribution on (x1, x2, y1, y2) by
specifying the conditional distribution of (x2, y2) given
(x1, y1): If (x1, y1) = (1, 1), then (x2, y2) takes the
values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1
2
, 1
6
,
1
6
, 1
6
respectively. Otherwise, (x2, y2) takes the values
(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities 1
6
, 1
6
, 1
6
, 1
2
respectively.
Now, suppose x1 turns out to be 1, and consider agent
A1"s bid in the first round. It is given by
b1
A1
= P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 1))
= P(y1 = 1|x1 = 1)
· P((x2, y2) = (0, 0)|x1 = 1, y1 = 1)
+P(y1 = 0|x1 = 1)
· P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 1, y1 = 0)
=
1
2
·
1
2
+
1
2
·
1
2
=
1
2
On the other hand, if x1 turns out to be 0, agent A1"s bid
would be given by
b1
A1
= P(C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) = 1|x1 = 0))
= P((x2, y2) = (1, 1)|x1 = 0)
=
1
2
Thus, irrespective of her bit, A1 will bid 0.5 in the first
round. Note that the function and distribution are 
symmetric between x and y, and so the same argument shows that
B1 will also bid 0.5 in the first round. Thus, the price p1
announced at the end of the first round reveals no 
information about x1 or y1. The reason this occurs is that, under
this distribution, the second carry bit C2 is statistically 
independent of the first carry bit (x1 ∧ y1); we will use this
trick again in the general construction.
Now, suppose that (x2, y2) is either (0, 1) or (1, 0). Then,
even if x2 and y2 are completely revealed by the first-round
price, the value of C2(x1, x2, y1, y2) is not revealed: It will
be 1 if x1 = y1 = 1 and 0 otherwise. Thus, we have shown
that at least 2 rounds of trading will be required to reveal
the function value in this case.
We now extend this construction to show by induction
that the function Cn takes n rounds to reach an equilibrium
in the worst case.
Theorem 5. There is a function Cn with 2n inputs and a
prior distribution Pn such that, in the worst case, the market
takes n rounds to reveal the value of Cn(·).
Proof: We prove the theorem by induction on n. The base
case for n = 2 has already been shown to be true. 
Starting from the distribution P2 described above, we construct
the distributions P3, P4, . . . , Pn by inductively applying the
following rule:
• Let x−n
denote the vector (x1, x2, . . . , xn−1), and 
define y−n
similarly. We extend the distribution Pn−1
on (x−n
, y−n
) to a distribution Pn on (x, y) by 
specifying the conditional distribution of (xn, yn) given
(x−n
, y−n
): If Cn−1(x−n
, y−n
) = 1, then (xn, yn) takes
the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with 
probabilities 1
2
, 1
6
, 1
6
, 1
6
respectively. Otherwise, (xn, yn) takes
the values (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (1, 1) with probabilities
1
6
, 1
6
, 1
6
, 1
2
respectively.
Claim: Under distribution Pn, for all i < n,
P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 1) = P(Cn(x, y) = 1|xi = 0).
162
Proof of claim: A similar calculation to that used for C2
above shows that the value of Cn(x, y) under this 
distribution is statistically independent of Cn−1(x−n
, y−n
). For
i < n, xi can affect the value of Cn only through Cn−1. Also,
by contruction of Pn, given the value of Cn−1, the 
distribution of Cn is independent of xi. It follows that Cn(x, y) is
statistically independent of xi as well. Of course, a similar
result holds for yi by symmetry.
Thus, in the first round, for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, the
bids of agents Ai and Bi do not reveal anything about their
private information. Thus, the first-round price does not
reveal any information about the value of (x−n
, y−n
).
On the other hand, agents An and Bn do have different
expectations of Cn(x) depending on whether their input bit
is a 0 or a 1; thus, the first-round price does reveal whether
neither, one, or both of xn and yn are 1. Now, consider
a situation in which (xn, yn) takes on the value (1, 0) or
(0, 1). We show that, in this case, after one round we are
left with the residual problem of computing the value of
Cn−1(x−n
, y−n
) under the prior Pn−1.
Clearly, when xn + yn = 1, Cn(x, y) = Cn−1(x−n
, y−n
).
Further, according to the construction of Pn, the event (xn+
yn = 1) has the same probability (1/3) for all values of
(x−n
, y−n
). Thus, conditioning on this fact does not alter
the probability distribution over (x−n
, y−n
); it must still be
Pn−1.
Finally, the inductive assumption tells us that solving this
residual problem will take at least n − 1 more rounds in the
worst case and hence that finding the value of Cn(x, y) takes
at least n rounds in the worst case. 2
5. DISCUSSION
Our results have been derived in a simplified model of an
information market. In this section, we discuss the 
applicability of these results to more general trading models.
Assuming that agents bid truthfully, Theorem 2 holds in
any model in which the price is a known stochastically 
monotone aggregate of agents" bids. While it seems reasonable
that the market price satisfies monotonicity properties, the
exact form of the aggregate function may not be known if
the volume of each user"s trades is not observable; this 
depends on the details of the market process. Theorem 3 and
Theorem 5 hold more generally; they only require that an
agent"s strategy depends only on her conditional 
expectation of the security"s value. Perhaps the most fragile 
result is Theorem 4, which relies on the linear form of the
Shapley-Shubik clearing price (in addition to the conditions
for Theorem 2); however, it seems plausible that a similar
dimension-based bound will hold for other families of 
nonlinear clearing prices.
Up to this point, we have described the model with the
same number of agents as bits of information. However, all
the results hold even if there is competition in the form of a
known number of agents who know each bit of information.
Indeed, modeling such competition may help alleviate the
strategic problems in our current model.
Another interesting approach to addressing the strategic
issue is to consider alternative markets that are at least
myopically incentive compatible. One example is a 
market mechanism called a market scoring rule, suggested by
Hanson [12]. These markets have the property that a 
riskneutral agent"s best myopic strategy is to truthfully bid her
current expected value of the security. Additionally, the
number of securities involved in each trade is fixed and 
publicly known. If the market structure is such that, for 
example, the current scoring rule is posted publicly after each
agent"s trade, then in equilibrium there is common 
knowledge of all agents" expectation, and hence Theorem 2 holds.
Theorem 3 also applies in this case, and hence we have the
same characterization for the set of computable Boolean
functions. This suggests that the problem of eliciting 
truthful responses may be orthogonal to the problem of 
computing the desired aggregate, reminiscent of the revelation
principle [18].
In this paper, we have restricted our attention to the
simplest possible aggregation problem: computing Boolean
functions of Boolean inputs. The proofs of Theorems 3 and 5
also hold if we consider Boolean functions of real inputs,
where each agent"s private information is a real number.
Further, Theorem 2 also holds provided the market reaches
equilibrium. With real inputs and arbitrary prior 
distributions, however, it is not clear that the market will reach an
equilibrium in a finite number of steps.
6. CONCLUSION
6.1 Summary
We have framed the process of information aggregation in
markets as a computation on distributed information. We
have developed a simplified model of an information 
market that we believe captures many of the important aspects
of real agent interaction in an information market. Within
this model, we prove several results characterizing precisely
what the market can compute and how quickly. Specifically,
we show that the market is guaranteed to converge to the
true rational expectations equilibrium if and only if the 
security payoff function is a weighted threshold function. We
prove that the process whereby agents reveal their 
information over time and learn from the resulting announced
prices takes at most n rounds to converge to the correct
full-information price in the worst case. We show that this
bound is tight within a factor of two.
6.2 Future work
We view this paper as a first step towards understanding
the computational power of information markets. Some 
interesting and important next steps include gaining a better
understanding of the following:
• The effect of price accuracy and precision: We have 
assumed that the clearing price is known with unlimited
precision; in practice, this will not be true. Further,
we have neglected influences on the market price other
than from rational traders; the market price may also
be influenced by other factors such as misinformed or
irrational traders. It is interesting to ask what 
aggregates can be computed even in the presence of noisy
prices.
• Incremental updates: If the agents have computed the
value of the function and a small number of input bits
are switched, can the new value of the function be
computed incrementally and quickly?
• Distributed computation: In our model, distributed 
information is aggregated through a centralized market
163
computation. In a sense, some of the computation 
itself is distributed among the participating agents, but
can the market computation also be distributed? For
example, can we find a good distributed-computational
model of a decentralized market?
• Agents" computation: We have not accounted for the
complexity of the computations that agents must do
to accurately update their beliefs after each round.
• Strategic market models: For reasons of simplicity and
tractability, we have directly assumed that agents bid
truthfully. A more satisfying approach would be to 
assume only rationality and solve for the resulting 
gametheoretic solution strategy, either in our current 
computational model or another model of an information
market.
• The common-prior assumption: Can we say anything
about the market behavior when agents" priors are
only approximately the same or when they differ 
greatly?
• Average-case analysis: Our negative results (Theorems
3 and 5) examine worst-case scenarios, and thus 
involve very specific prior probability distributions. It is
interesting to ask whether we would get very different
results for generic prior distributions.
• Information market design: Non-threshold functions
can be implemented by layering two or more 
threshold functions together. What is the minimum number
of threshold securities required to implement a given
function? This is exactly the problem of minimizing
the size of a neural network, a well-studied problem
known to be NP-hard [15]. What configuration of 
securities can best approximate a given function? Are
there ways to define and configure securities to speed
up convergence to equilibrium? What is the 
relationship between machine learning (e.g., neural-network
learning) and information-market design?
