ABSTRACT
One way to help all users of commercial Web search engines be
more successful in their searches is to better understand what
those users with greater search expertise are doing, and use this
knowledge to benefit everyone. In this paper we study the
interaction logs of advanced search engine users (and those not so
advanced) to better understand how these user groups search. The
results show that there are marked differences in the queries,
result clicks, post-query browsing, and search success of users we
classify as advanced (based on their use of query operators),
relative to those classified as non-advanced. Our findings have
implications for how advanced users should be supported during
their searches, and how their interactions could be used to help
searchers of all experience levels find more relevant information
and learn improved searching strategies.

1. INTRODUCTION
The formulation of query statements that capture both the salient
aspects of information needs and are meaningful to Information
Retrieval (IR) systems poses a challenge for many searchers [3].
Commercial Web search engines such as Google, Yahoo!, and
Windows Live Search offer users the ability to improve the
quality of their queries using query operators such as quotation
marks, plus and minus signs, and modifiers that restrict the search
to a particular site or type of file. These techniques can be useful
in improving result precision yet, other than via log analyses (e.g.,
[15][27]), they have generally been overlooked by the research
community in attempts to improve the quality of search results.
IR research has generally focused on alternative ways for users to
specify their needs rather than increasing the uptake of advanced
syntax. Research on practical techniques to supplement existing
search technology and support users has been intensifying in
recent years (e.g. [18][34]). However, it is challenging to
implement such techniques at large scale with tolerable latencies.
Typical queries submitted to Web search engines take the form of
a series of tokens separated by spaces. There is generally an
implied Boolean AND operator between tokens that restricts
search results to documents containing all query terms. De Lima
and Pedersen [7] investigated the effect of parsing, phrase
recognition, and expansion on Web search queries. They showed
that the automatic recognition of phrases in queries can improve
result precision in Web search. However, the value of advanced
syntax for typical searchers has generally been limited, since most
users do not know about advanced syntax or do not understand
how to use it [15]. Since it appears operators can help retrieve
relevant documents, further investigation of their use is warranted.
In this paper we explore the use of query operators in more detail
and propose alternative applications that do not require all users to
use advanced syntax explicitly. We hypothesize that searchers
who use advanced query syntax demonstrate a degree of search
expertise that the majority of the user population does not; an
assertion supported by previous research [13]. Studying the
behavior of these advanced search engine users may yield
important insights about searching and result browsing from
which others may benefit.
Using logs gathered from a large number of consenting users, we
investigate differences between the search behavior of those that
use advanced syntax and those that do not, and differences in the
information those users target. We are interested in answering
three research questions:
(i) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and other characteristics of a search?
(ii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and post-query navigation behaviors?
(iii) Is there a relationship between the use of advanced syntax
and measures of search success?
Through an experimental study and analysis, we offer potential
answers for each of these questions. A relationship between the
use of advanced syntax and any of these features could support
the design of systems tailored to advanced search engine users, or
use advanced users" interactions to help non-advanced users be
more successful in their searches.
We describe related work in Section 2, the data we used in this
log-based study in Section 3, the search characteristics on which
we focus our analysis in Section 4, and the findings of this
analysis in Section 5. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of
this research, and we conclude in Section 7.
2. RELATED WORK
Factors such as lack of domain knowledge, poor understanding of
the document collection being searched, and a poorly developed
information need can all influence the quality of the queries that
users submit to IR systems ([24],[28]). There has been a variety
of research into different ways of helping users specify their
information needs more effectively. Belkin et al. [4] experimented
with providing additional space for users to type a more verbose
description of their information needs. A similar approach was
attempted by Kelly et al. [18], who used clarification forms to
elicit additional information about the search context from users.
These approaches have been shown to be effective in best-match
retrieval systems where longer queries generally lead to more
relevant search results [4]. However, in Web search, where many
of the systems are based on an extended Boolean retrieval model,
longer queries may actually hurt retrieval performance, leading to
a small number of potentially irrelevant results being retrieved. It
is not simply sufficient to request more information from users;
this information must be of better quality.
Relevance Feedback (RF) [22] and interactive query expansion
[9] are popular techniques that have been used to improve the
quality of information that users provide to IR systems regarding
their information needs. In the case of RF, the user presents the
system with examples of relevant information that are then used to
formulate an improved query or retrieve a new set of documents.
It has proven difficult to get users to use RF in the Web domain
due to difficulty in conveying the meaning and the benefit of RF
to typical users [17]. Query suggestions offered based on query
logs have the potential to improve retrieval performance with
limited user burden. This approach is limited to re-executing
popular queries, and searchers often ignore the suggestions
presented to them [1]. In addition, both of these techniques do not
help users learn to produce more effective queries.
Most commercial search engines provide advanced query syntax
that allows users to specify their information needs in more detail.
Query modifiers such as ‘+" (plus), ‘−" (minus), and ‘  " (double
quotes) can be used to emphasize, deemphasize, and group query
terms. Boolean operators (AND, OR, and NOT) can join terms
and phrases, and modifiers such as site: and link: can be used
to restrict the search space. Queries created with these techniques
can be powerful. However, this functionality is often hidden from
the immediate view of the searcher, and unless she knows the
syntax, she must use text fields, pull-down menus and combo
boxes available via a dedicated advanced search interface to
access these features.
Log-based analysis of users" interactions with the Excite and
AltaVista search engines has shown that only 10-20% of queries
contained any advanced syntax [14][25]. This analysis can be a
useful way of capturing characteristics of users interacting with IR
systems. Research in user modeling [6] and personalization [30]
has shown that gathering more information about users can
improve the effectiveness of searches, but require more
information about users than is typically available from
interaction logs alone. Unless coupled with a qualitative
technique, such as a post-session questionnaire [23], it can be
difficult to associate interactions with user characteristics. In our
study we conjecture that given the difficulty in locating advanced
search features within the typical search interface, and the
potential problems in understanding the syntax, those users that do
use advanced syntax regularly represent a distinct class of
searchers who will exhibit other common search behaviors.
Other studies of advanced searchers" search behaviors have
attempted to better understand the strategic knowledge they have
acquired. However, such studies are generally limited in size
(e.g., [13][19]) or focus on domain expertise in areas such as
healthcare or e-commerce (e.g., [5]). Nonetheless, they can give
valuable insight about the behaviors of users with domain, system,
or search expertise that exceeds that of the average user.
Querying behavior in particular has been studied extensively to
better understand users [31] and support other users [16].
In this paper we study other search characteristics of users of
advanced syntax in an attempt to determine whether there is
anything different about how these search engine users search,
and whether their searches can be used to benefit those who do
not make use of the advanced features of search engines. To do
this we use interaction logs gathered from large set of consenting
users over a prolonged period.
In the next section we describe the data we use to study the
behavior of the users who use advanced syntax, relative to those
that do not use this syntax.
3. DATA
To perform this study we required a description of the querying
and browsing behavior of many searchers, preferably over a
period of time to allow patterns in user behavior to be analyzed.
To obtain these data we mined the interaction logs of consenting
Web users over a period of 13 weeks, from January to April 2006.
When downloading a partner client-side application, the users
were invited to consent to their interaction with Web pages being
anonymously recorded (with a unique identifier assigned to each
user) and used to improve the performance of future systems.1
The information contained in these log entries included a unique
identifier for the user, a timestamp for each page view, a unique
browser window identifier (to resolve ambiguities in determining
which browser a page was viewed), and the URL of the Web page
visited. This provided us with sufficient data on querying
behavior (from interaction with search engines), and browsing
behavior (from interaction with the pages that follow a search) to
more broadly investigate search behavior.
In addition to the data gathered during the course of this study we
also had relevance judgments of documents that users examined
for 10,680 unique query statements present in the interaction logs.
These judgments were assigned on a six-point scale by trained
human judges at the time the data were collected. We use these
judgments in this analysis to assess the relevance of sites users
visited on their browse trail away from search result pages.
We studied the interaction logs of 586,029 unique users, who
submitted millions of queries to three popular search 
enginesGoogle, Yahoo!, and MSN Search - over the 13-week duration of
the study. To limit the effect of search engine bias, we used four
operators common to all three search engines: + (plus), − (minus),
  (double quotes), and site: (to restrict the search to a domain
or Web page) as advanced syntax. 1.12% of the queries submitted
contained at least one of these four operators. 51,080 (8.72%) of
users used query operators in any of their queries. In the
remainder of this paper, we will refer to these users as advanced
searchers. We acknowledge that the direct relationship between
query syntax usage and search expertise has only been studied
1
It is worth noting that if users did not provide their consent, then
their interaction was not recorded and analyzed in this study.
(and shown) in a few studies (e.g., [13]), but we feel that this is a
reasonable criterion for a log-based investigation. We conjecture
that these advanced searchers do possess a high level of search
expertise, and will show later in the paper that they demonstrate
behavioral characteristics consistent with search expertise.
To handle potential outlier users that may skew our data analysis,
we removed users who submitted fewer than 50 queries in the
study"s 13-week duration. This left us with 188,405 users −
37,795 (20.1%) advanced users and 150,610 (79.9%) 
nonadvanced users − whose interactions we study in more detail. If
significant differences emerge between these groups, it is
conceivable that these interactions could be used to automatically
classify users and adjust a search system"s interface and result
weighting to better match the current user.
The privacy of our volunteers was maintained throughout the
entire course of the study: no personal information was elicited
about them, participants were assigned a unique anonymous
identifier that could not be traced back to them, and we made no
attempt to identify a particular user or study individual behavior in
any way. All findings were aggregated over multiple users, and
no information other than consent for logging was elicited.
To find out more about these users we studied whether those
using advanced syntax exhibited other search behaviors that were
not observed in those who did not use this syntax. We focused on
querying, navigation, and overall search success to compare the
user groups. In the next section we describe in more detail the
search features that we used.
4. SEARCH FEATURES
We elected to choose features that described a variety of aspects
of the search process: queries, result clicks, post-query browsing,
and search success. The query and result-click characteristics we
chose to examine are described in more detail in Table 1.
Table 1. Query and result-click features (per user).
Feature Meaning
Queries Per Second (QPS) Avg. number of queries per
second between initial query
and end-of-session
Query Repeat Rate (QRR) Fraction of queries that are
repeats
Query Word Length (QWL) Avg. number of words in query
Queries Per Day (QPD) Avg. number of queries per day
Avg. Click Position (ACP) Avg. rank of clicked results
Click Probability (CP) Ratio of result clicks to queries
Avg. Seconds To Click (ASC) Avg. search to result click
interval
These seven features give us a useful overview of users" direct
interactions with search engines, but not of how users are looking
for relevant information beyond the result page or how successful
they are in locating relevant information. Therefore, in addition to
these characteristics we also studied some relevant aspects of
users" post-query browsing behavior. To do this, we extracted
search trails from the interaction logs described in the previous
section. A search trail is a series of visited Web pages connected
via a hyperlink trail, initiated with a search result page and
terminating on one of the following events: navigation to any page
not linked from the current page, closing of the active browser
window, or a session inactivity timeout of 30 minutes. More
detail on the extraction of the search trails are provided in
previous work [33]. In total, around 12.5 million search trails
(containing around 60 million documents) were extracted from the
logs for all users. The median number of search trails per user was
30. The median number of steps in the trails was 3. All search
trails contained one search result page and at least one page on a
hyperlink trail leading from the result page.
The extraction of these trails allowed us to study aspects of 
postquery browsing behavior, namely the average duration of users"
search sessions, the average duration of users" search trails, the
average display time of each document, the average number of
steps in users" search trails, the number of branches in users"
navigation patterns, and the number of back operations in users"
search trails. All search trails contain at least one branch
representing any forward motion on the browse path. A trail can
have additional branches if the user clicks the browser"s back
button and immediately proceeds forward to another page prior to
the next (if any) back operation. The post-query browsing features
are described further in Table 2.
Table 2. Post-query browsing features (per trail).
Feature Meaning
Session Seconds (SS) Average session length (in seconds)
Trail Seconds (TS) Average trail length (in seconds)
Display Seconds (DS) Average display time for each page on
the trail (in seconds)
Num. Steps (NS) Average number of steps from the page
following the results page to the end of
the trail
Num. Branches (NB) Average number of branches
Num. Backs (NBA) Average number of back operations
As well as using these attributes of users" interactions, we also
used the relevance judgments described earlier in the paper to
measure the degree of search success based on the relevance
judgments assigned to pages that lie on the search trail. Given
that we did not have access to relevance assessments from our
users, we approximated these assessments using judgments
collected as part of ongoing research into search engine
performance.2
These judgments were created by trained human
assessors for 10,680 unique queries. Of the 1,420,625 steps on
search trails that started with any one of these queries, we have
relevance judgments for 802,160 (56.4%). We use these
judgments to approximate search success for a given trail in a
number of ways. In Table 3 we list these measures.
2
Our assessment of search success is fairly crude compared to
what would have been possible if we had been able to contact
our subjects. We address this problem in a manner similar to
that used by the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) [21], in that
since we cannot determine perceived search success, we
approximate search success based on assigned relevance scores
of visited documents.
Table 3. Relevance judgment measures (per trail).
Measure Meaning
First Judgment assigned to the first page in the trail
Last Judgment assigned to the last page in the trail
Average Average judgment across all pages in the trail
Maximum Maximum judgment across all pages in the trail
These measures are used during our analysis to estimate the
relevance of the pages viewed at different stages in the trails, and
allow us to estimate search success in different ways. We chose
multiple measures, as users may encounter relevant information in
many ways and at different points in the trail (e.g., single 
highlyrelevant document or gradually over the course of the trail).
The features described in this section allowed us to analyze
important attributes of the search process that must be better
understood if we are to support users in their searching. In the
next section we present the findings of the analysis.
5. FINDINGS
Our analysis is divided into three parts: analysis of query behavior
and interaction with the results page, analysis of post-query
navigation behavior, and search success in terms of locating
judged-relevant documents. Parametric statistical testing is used,
and the level of significance for the statistical tests is set to .05.
5.1 Query and result-click behavior
We were interested in comparing the query and result-click
behaviors of our advanced and non-advanced users. In Table 4
we show the mean average values for each of the seven search
features for our users. We use padvanced to denote the percentage of
all queries from each user that contains advanced syntax (i.e.,
padvanced = 0% means a user never used advanced syntax). The
table shows values for users that do not use query operators (0%),
users who submitted at least one query with operators (≥ 0%),
through to users whose queries contained operators at least 
threequarters of the time (≥ 75%).
Table 4. Query and result click features (per user).

ASC 87.71 88.16 112.44 102.12 79.13
%Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04%
We compared the query and result click features of users who did
not use any advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%) in any of their
queries with those who used advanced syntax in at least one query
(padvanced > 0%). The columns corresponding to these two groups
are bolded in Table 4. We performed an independent measures 
ttest between these groups for each of the features. Since this
analysis involved many features, we use a Bonferroni correction
to control the experiment-wise error rate and set the alpha level
(α) to .007, i.e., .05 divided by the number of features. This
correction reduces the number of Type I errors i.e., rejecting null
hypotheses that are true. All differences between the groups were
statistically significant (all t(188403) ≥ 2.81, all p ≤ .002).
However, given the large sample sizes, all differences in the
means were likely to be statistically significant. We applied a
Cohen"s d-test to determine the effect size for each of the
comparisons between the advanced and non-advanced user
groups. Ordering in descending order by effect size, the main
findings are that relative to non-advanced users, advanced search
engine users:
• Query less frequently in a session (d = 1.98)
• Compose longer queries (d = .69)
• Click further down the result list (d = .67)
• Submit more queries per day (d = .49)
• Are less likely to click on a result (d = .32)
• Repeat queries more often (d = .16)
The increased likelihood that advanced search engine users will
click further down the result list implies that they may be less
trusting of the search engines" ability to rank the most relevant
document first, that they are more willing to explore beyond the
most popular pages for a given query, that they may be submitting
different types of queries (e.g., informational rather than
navigational), or that they may have customized their search
settings to display more than only the default top-10 results.
Many of the findings listed are consistent with those identified in
other studies of advanced searchers" querying and result-click
behaviors [13][34]. Given that the only criteria we employed to
classify a user as an advanced searcher was their use of advanced
syntax, it is certainly promising that this criterion seems to
identify users that interact in a way consistent with that reported
previously for those with more search expertise.
As mentioned earlier, the advanced search engine users for which
the average values shown in Table 4 are computed are those who
submit 50 or more queries in the 13 week duration of the data
collection and submit at least one query containing advanced
query operators. In other words, we consider users whose
percentage of queries containing advanced syntax, padvanced, is
greater than zero. The use of query operators in any queries,
regardless of frequency, suggests that a user knows about the
existence of the operators, and implies a greater degree of
familiarity with the search system. We further hypothesized that
users whose queries more frequently contained advanced syntax
may be more advanced search engine users. To test this we
investigated varying the query threshold required to qualify for
advanced status (padvanced). We incremented padvanced one
percentage point at a time, and recorded the values of the seven
query and result-click features at each point. The values of the
features at four milestones (> 0%, ≥ 25%, ≥ 50%, and ≥ 75%) are
shown in Table 4. As can be seen in the table, as padvanced
increases, differences in the features between those using
advanced syntax and those not using advanced syntax become
more substantial. However, it is interesting to note that as padvanced
increases, the number of queries submitted per day actually falls
(Pearson"s R = −.512, t(98) = 5.98, p < .0001). More advanced
users may need to pose fewer queries to find relevant information.
To study the patterns of relationship among these dependent
variables (including the padvanced), we applied factor analysis [26].
Table 5 shows the intercorrelation matrix between the features
and the percentage of queries with operators (Padvanced). Each cell
in the table contains the Pearson"s correlation coefficient between
the two features for a given row-column pair.
Table 5. Intercorrelation matrix (query / result-click features).

CP 1.00 .654
ASC 1.00
It is only the first data column and row that reflect the correlations
between padvanced and the other query and result-click features.
Columns 2 - 8 show the inter-correlations between the other
features. There are strong positive correlations between some of
the features (e.g., the number of words in the query (QWL) and
the average probability of clicking on a search result (ACP)).
However, there were also fairly strong negative correlations
between some features (e.g., the average length of the queries
(QWL) and the probability of clicking on a search result (CP)).
The factor analysis revealed the presence of two factors that
account for 83.6% of the variance. As is standard practice in
factor analysis, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30
or less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their
respective loadings, can be expressed as:
Factor A = .98(QRR) + .97(padv) + .97(QPS)
+ .71(ACP) + .69(QWL)
Factor B = .96(CP) + .90(QPD) + .67(ACP) + .52(ASC)
Variance in the query and result-click behavior of our advanced
search engine users can be expressed using these two constructs.
Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.5% of the variance.
It appears to represent a very basic dimension of variance that
covers query attributes and querying behavior, and suggests a
relationship between query properties (length, frequency,
complexity, and repetition) and the position of users" clicks in the
result list. The dimension underlying Factor B accounts for
33.1% of the variance, and describes attributes of result-click
behavior, and a strong correlation between result clicks and the
number of queries submitted each day.
Summary: In this section we have shown that there are marked
differences in aspects of the querying and result-clickthrough
behaviors of advanced users relative to non-advanced users. We
have also shown that the greater the proportion of queries that
contain advanced syntax, the larger the differences in query and
clickthrough behaviors become. A factor analysis revealed the
presence of two dimensions that adequately characterize variance
in the query and result-click features. In the querying dimension
query attributes, such as the length and proportion that contain
advanced syntax, and querying behavior, such as the number of
queries submitted per day both affect result-click position. In
addition, in the result-click dimension, it appears that daily
querying frequency influences result-click features such as the
likelihood that a user will click on a search result and the amount
of time between result presentation and the search result click.
The features used in this section are only interactions with search
engines in the form of queries and result clicks. We did not
address how users searched for information beyond the result
page. In the next section we use the search trails described in
Section 4 to analyze the post-query browsing behavior of users.
5.2 Post-query browsing behavior
In this section we look at several attributes of the search trails
users followed beyond the results page in an attempt to discern
whether the use of advanced search syntax can be used as a
predictor of aspects of post-query interaction behavior.
As we did previously, we first describe the mean average values
for each of the browsing features, across all advanced users (i.e.
padvanced > 0%), all non-advanced users (i.e., padvanced = 0%), and all
users regardless of their estimated search expertise level. We then
look at the effect on the browsing features of increasing the value
of padvanced required to be considered advanced from 1% to
100%. In Table 6 we present the average values for each of these
features for the two groups of users. Also shown are the
percentage of search trails (%Trails) and the percentage of users
(%Users) used to compute the averages.
Table 6. Post-query browsing features (per trail).

%Users 79.90% 20.10% .79% .18% .04%
As can be seen from Table 6, there are differences in the 
postquery interaction behaviors of advanced users (padvanced > 0%)
relative to that do not use query operators in any of their queries
(padvanced = 0%). Once again, the columns of interest in this
comparison are bolded. As we did in Section 5.1 for query and
result-click behavior, we performed an independent measures 
ttest between the values reported for each of the post-query
browsing features. The results of this test suggest that differences
between those that use advanced syntax and those that do not are
significant (t(12495029) ≥ 3.09, p ≤ .002, α = .008). Given the
sample sizes, all of the differences between means in the two
groups were significant. However, we once again applied a
Cohen"s d-test to determine the effect size. The findings (ranked
in descending order based on effect size), show that relative to
non-advanced users, advanced search engine users:
• Revisit pages in the trail less often (d = .45)
• Spend less time traversing each search trail (d = .38)
• Spend less time viewing each document (d = .28)
• Branch (i.e., proceed to new pages following a back
operation) less often (d = .18)
• Follow search trails with fewer steps (d = .16)
It seems that advanced users use a more directed searching style
than non-advanced users. They spend less time following search
trails and view the documents that lie on those trails for less time.
This is in accordance with our earlier proposition that advanced
users seem able to discern document relevance in less time.
Advanced users also tend to deviate less from a direct path as they
search, with fewer revisits to previously-visited pages and less
branching during their searching.
As we did in the previous section, we increased the padvanced
threshold one point at a time. With the exception of number of
back operations (NB), the values attributable to each of the
features change as padvanced increased. It seems that the differences
noted earlier between non-advanced users and those that use any
advanced syntax become more significant as padvanced increases.
As in the previous section, we conducted a factor analysis of these
features and padvanced. Table 7 shows the intercorrelation matrix
for all these variables.

increases, the values of many of the post-query browsing features
decrease. Only the average session time (SS) exhibits a strong
positive correlation with padvanced. The factor analysis revealed the
presence of two factors that account for 89.8% of the variance.
Once again, all features with an absolute factor loading of .30 or
less were removed. The two factors that emerged, with their
respective loadings, can be expressed as:
Factor A = .95(DS) + .88 (TS) − .91(SS) − .95(padv)
Factor B = .99(NBA) + .93(NS) + .91(NB)
Variance in the query and result-click behavior of those who use
query operators can be expressed using these two constructs.
Factor A is the most powerful, contributing 50.1% of the variance.
It appears to represent a very basic temporal dimension that
covers timing and percentage of queries with advanced syntax,
and suggests a negative relationship between time spent searching
and overall session time, and a negative relationship between time
spent searching and padvanced. The navigation dimension
underlying Factor B accounts for 39.7% of the variance, and
describes attributes of post-query navigation, all of which seem to
be strongly correlated with each other but not padvanced or timing.
Summary: In this section we have shown that advanced users"
post-query browsing behavior appears more directed than that of
non-advanced users. Although their search sessions are longer,
advanced users follow fewer search trails during their sessions,
(i.e., submit fewer queries), their search trails are shorter, and
their trails exhibit fewer deviations or regressions to previously
encountered pages. We also showed that as padvanced increases,
session time increases (perhaps more advanced users are
multitasking between search and other operations), and search
interaction becomes more focused, perhaps because advanced
users are able target relevant information more effectively, with
less need for regressions or deviations in their search trails.
As well as interaction behaviors such as queries, result clicks, and
post-query browse behavior, another important aspect of the
search process is the attainment of information relevant to the
query. In the next section we analyze the success of advanced and
non-advanced users in obtaining relevant information.
5.3 Search success
As described earlier, we used six-level relevance judgments
assigned to query-document pairs as an approximate measure of
search success based on documents encountered on search trails.
However, the queries for which we have judgments generally did
not contain advanced operators. To maximize the likelihood of
coverage we removed advanced operators from all queries when
retrieving the relevance judgments. The mean average relevance
judgment values for each of the four metrics - first, last, average,
and maximum - are shown in Table 8 for non-advanced users
(0%) and advanced users (> 0%).
Table 8. Search success (min. = 1, max. = 6) (per trail).
Feature

First M 4.03 4.19 4.24 4.26 4.57
SD 1.58 1.56 1.34 1.38 1.27
Last M 3.79 3.92 4.00 4.13 4.35
SD 1.60 1.57 1.29 1.25 .89
Max. M 4.04 4.20 4.19 4.19 4.46
SD 1.63 1.51 1.28 1.37 1.25
Avg. M 3.93 4.06 4.08 4.08 4.26
SD 1.57 1.51 1.23 1.32 1.14
The findings suggest that users who use advanced syntax at all
(padvanced > 0%) were more successful - across all four 
measuresthan those who never used advanced syntax (padvanced = 0%). Not
only were these users more successful in their searching, but they
were consistently more successful (i.e., the standard deviation in
relevance scores is lower for advanced users and continues to drop
as padvanced increases). The differences in the four mean average
relevance scores for each metric between these two user groups
were significant with independent measures t-tests (all t(516765)
≥ 3.29, p ≤ .001, α = .0125). As we increase the value of padvanced
as in previous sections, the average relevance score across all
metrics also increases (all Pearson"s R ≥ .654), suggesting that
more advanced users are also more likely to succeed in their
searching. The searchers that use advanced operators may have
additional skills in locating relevant information, or may know
where this information resides based on previous experience.3
Despite the fact that the four metrics targeted different parts of the
search trail (e.g., first vs. last) or different ways to gather relevant
information (e.g., average vs. maximum), the differences between
groups and within the advanced group were consistent.

Although in our logs there was no obvious indication of more
revisitation by advanced search engine users.
To see whether there were any differences in the nature of the
queries submitted by advanced search engine users, we studied the
distribution of the four advanced operators: quotation marks, plus,
minus, and site:. In Table 9 we show how these operators were
distributed in all queries submitted by these users.
Table 9. Distribution of query operators.
Feature
padvanced
> 0% ≥ 25% ≥ 50% ≥ 75%
Quotes () 71.08 77.09 70.33 70.00
Plus (+) 6.84 13.31 19.21 33.90
Minus (−) 6.62 2.88 1.96 2.42
Site: 21.55 12.72 13.04 9.86
Avg. num. operators 1.08 1.14 1.28 1.49
The distribution of the quotes, plus, and minus operators are
similar amongst the four levels of padvanced, with quotes being the
most popular of the four operators used. However, it appears that
the plus operator is the main differentiator between the padvanced
user groups. This operator, which forces the search engine to
include in the query terms that are usually excluded by default
(e.g. the, a), may account for some portion of the difference
in observed search success.4
However, this does not capture the
contribution that each of these operators makes to the increase in
relevance compared with excluding the operator. To gain some
insight into this, we examined the impact that each of the
operators had on the relevance of retrieved results. We focused
on queries in padvanced > 0% where the same user had issued a
query without operators and the same query with operators either
before or afterwards. Although there were few queries with
matching pairs - and almost all of them contained quotes - there
was a small (approximately 10%) increase in the average
relevance judgment score assigned to documents on the trail with
quotes in the initial query. It may be the case that quoted queries
led to retrieval of more relevant documents, or that they better
match the perceived needs of relevance judges and therefore lead
to judged documents receiving higher scores. More analysis
similar to [8] is required to test these propositions further.
Summary: In this section we have used several measures to study
the search success of advanced and non-advanced users. The
findings of our analysis suggest that advanced search engine users
are more successful and have more consistency in the relevance of
the pages they visit. Their additional search expertise may make
these users better able to make better decisions about which
documents to view, meaning they encounter consistently more
relevant information on their searches. In addition, within the
group of advanced users there is a strong correlation between
padvanced and the degree of search success. Advanced search
engine users may be more adept at combining query operators to
formulate powerful query statements. We now discuss the
findings from all three subsections and their implications for the
design of improved Web search systems.

It is worth noting that there were no significant differences in the
distribution of usage of the three search engines - Google,
Yahoo!, or Windows Live Search - amongst advanced search
engine users, or between advanced users and non-advanced.
6. DISCUSSION AND IMPLICATIONS
Our findings indicate significant differences in the querying,
result-click, post-query navigation, and search success of those
that use advanced syntax versus those that do not. Many of these
findings mirror those already found in previous studies with
groups of self-identified novices and experts [13][19]. There are
several ways in which a commercial search engine system might
benefit from a quantitative indication of searcher expertise. This
might be yet another feature available to a ranking engine; i.e. it
may be the case that expert searchers in some cases prefer
different pages than novice searchers. The user interface to a
search engine might be tailored to a user"s expertise level; perhaps
even more advanced features such as term weighting and query
expansion suggestions could be presented to more experienced
searchers while preserving the simplicity of the basic interface for
novices. Result presentation might also be customized based on
search skill level; future work might re-evaluate the benefits of
content snippets, thumbnails, etc. in a manner that allows different
outcomes for different expertise levels. Additionally, if browsing
histories are available, the destinations of advanced searchers
could be used as suggested results for queries, bypassing and
potentially improving upon the traditional search process [10].
The use of the interaction of advanced search engine users to
guide others with less expertise is an attractive proposition for the
designers of search systems. In part, these searchers may have
more post-query browsing expertise that allows them to overcome
the shortcomings of search systems [29]. Their interactions can
be used to point users to places that advanced search engine users
visit [32] or simply to train less experienced searchers how to
search more effectively. However, if expert users are going to be
used in this way, issues of data sparsity will need to be overcome.
Our advanced users only accounted for 20.1% of the users whose
interactions we studied. Whilst these may be amongst the most
active users it is unlikely that they will view documents that cover
large number of subject areas. However, rather than focusing on
where they go (which is perhaps more appropriate for those with
domain knowledge), advanced search engine users may use
moves, tactics and strategies [2] that inexperienced users can learn
from. Encouraging users to use advanced syntax helps them learn
how to formulate better search queries; leveraging the searching
style of expert searchers could help them learn more successful
post-query interactions.
One potential limitation to the results we report is that in prior
research, it has been shown that query operators do not
significantly improve the effectiveness of Web search results [8],
and that searchers may be able to perform just as well without
them [27]. It could therefore be argued that the users who do not
use query operators are in fact more advanced, since they do not
waste time using potentially redundant syntax in their query
statements. However, this seems unlikely given that those who
use advanced syntax exhibited search behaviors typical of users
with expertise [13], and are more successful in their searching.
However, in future work we will expand of definition of
advanced user beyond attributes of the query to also include
other interaction behaviors, some of which we have defined in this
study, and other avenues of research such as eye-tracking [12].
7. CONCLUSIONS
In this paper we have described a log-based study of search
behavior on the Web that has demonstrated that the use of
advanced search syntax is correlated with other aspects of search
behavior such as querying, result clickthrough, post-query
navigation, and search success. Those that use this syntax are
active online for longer, spend less time querying and traversing
search trails, exhibit less deviation in their trails, are more likely
to explore search results, take less time to click on results, and are
more successful in there searching. These are all traits that we
would expect expert searchers to exhibit. Crude classification of
users based on just one feature that is easily extractable from the
query stream yields remarkable results about the interaction
behavior of users that do not use the syntax and those that do. As
we have suggested, search systems may leverage the interactions
of these users for improved document ranking, page
recommendation, or even user training. Future work will include
the development of search interfaces and modified retrieval
engines that make use of these information-rich features, and
further investigation into the use of these features as indicators of
search expertise, including a cross-correlation analysis between
result click and post-query behavior.
