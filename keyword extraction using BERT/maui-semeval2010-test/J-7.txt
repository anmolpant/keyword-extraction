ABSTRACT
In many settings, competing technologies - for example, 
operating systems, instant messenger systems, or document 
formatscan be seen adopting a limited amount of compatibility with one 
another; in other words, the difficulty in using multiple technologies
is balanced somewhere between the two extremes of impossibility
and effortless interoperability. There are a range of reasons why
this phenomenon occurs, many of which - based on legal, social,
or business considerations - seem to defy concise mathematical
models. Despite this, we show that the advantages of limited 
compatibility can arise in a very simple model of diffusion in social
networks, thus offering a basic explanation for this phenomenon in
purely strategic terms.
Our approach builds on work on the diffusion of innovations in
the economics literature, which seeks to model how a new 
technology A might spread through a social network of individuals who
are currently users of technology B. We consider several ways of
capturing the compatibility of A and B, focusing primarily on a
model in which users can choose to adopt A, adopt B, or - at an
extra cost - adopt both A and B. We characterize how the 
ability of A to spread depends on both its quality relative to B, and
also this additional cost of adopting both, and find some surprising
non-monotonicity properties in the dependence on these 
parameters: in some cases, for one technology to survive the introduction
of another, the cost of adopting both technologies must be balanced
within a narrow, intermediate range. We also extend the framework
to the case of multiple technologies, where we find that a simple

1. INTRODUCTION
Diffusion and Networked Coordination Games. A fundamental
question in the social sciences is to understand the ways in which
new ideas, behaviors, and practices diffuse through populations.
Such issues arise, for example, in the adoption of new technologies,
the emergence of new social norms or organizational conventions,
or the spread of human languages [2, 14, 15, 16, 17]. An active line
of research in economics and mathematical sociology is concerned
with modeling these types of diffusion processes as a coordination
game played on a social network [1, 5, 7, 13, 19].
We begin by discussing one of the most basic game-theoretic
diffusion models, proposed in an influential paper of Morris [13],
which will form the starting point for our work here. We describe
it in terms of the following technology adoption scenario, though
there are many other examples that would serve the same purpose.
Suppose there are two instant messenger (IM) systems A and B,
which are not interoperable - users must be on the same system
in order to communicate. There is a social network G on the users,
indicating who wants to talk to whom, and the endpoints of each
edge (v, w) play a coordination game with possible strategies A
or B: if v and w each choose IM system B, then they they each
receive a payoff of q (since they can talk to each other using system
B); if they each choose IM system A, then they they each receive
a payoff of 1 − q; and if they choose opposite systems, then they
each receive a payoff of 0 (reflecting the lack of interoperability).
Note that A is the better technology if q < 1
2
, in the sense that
A-A payoffs would then exceed B-B payoffs, while A is the worse
technology if q > 1
2
.

A number of qualitative insights can be derived from a diffusion
model even at this level of simplicity. Specifically, consider a 
network G, and let all nodes initially play B. Now suppose a small
number of nodes begin adopting strategy A instead. If we apply
best-response updates to nodes in the network, then nodes in effect
will be repeatedly applying the following simple rule: switch to A
if enough of your network neighbors have already adopted A. (E.g.
you begin using a particular IM system - or social-networking
site, or electronic document format - if enough of your friends
are users of it.) As this unfolds, there can be a cascading sequence
of nodes switching to A, such that a network-wide equilibrium is
reached in the limit: this equilibrium may involve uniformity, with
all nodes adopting A; or it may involve coexistence, with the nodes
partitioned into a set adopting A and a set adopting B, and edges
yielding zero payoff connecting the two sets. Morris [13] provides
a set of elegant graph-theoretic characterizations for when these
qualitatively different types of equilibria arise, in terms of the 
underlying network topology and the quality of A relative to B (i.e.
the relative sizes of 1 − q and q).
Compatibility, Interoperability, and Bilinguality. In most of the
settings that form the motivation for diffusion models, coexistence
(however unbalanced) is the typical outcome: for example, human
languages and social conventions coexist along geographic 
boundaries; it is a stable outcome for the financial industry to use 
Windows while the entertainment industry uses Mac OS. An important
piece that is arguably missing from the basic game-theoretic 
models of diffusion, however, is a more detailed picture of what is 
happening at the coexistence boundary, where the basic form of the
model posits nodes that adopt A linked to nodes that adopt B.
In these motivating settings for the models, of course, one very
often sees interface regions in which individuals essentially become
bilingual. In the case of human language diffusion, this 
bilinguality is meant literally: geographic regions where there is substantial
interaction with speakers of two different languages tend to have
inhabitants who speak both. But bilinguality is also an essential
feature of technological interaction: in the end, many people have
accounts on multiple IM systems, for example, and more 
generally many maintain the ability to work within multiple computer
systems so as to collaborate with people embedded in each.
Taking this view, it is natural to ask how diffusion models 
behave when extended so that certain nodes can be bilingual in this
very general sense, adopting both strategies at some cost to 
themselves. What might we learn from such an extension? To begin
with, it has the potential to provide a valuable perspective on the
question of compatibility and incompatibility that underpins 
competition among technology companies. There is a large literature
on how compatibility among technologies affects competition 
between firms, and in particular how incompatibility may be a 
beneficial strategic decision for certain participants in a market [3, 4, 8, 9,
12]. Whinston [18] provides an interesting taxonomy of different
kinds of strategic incompatibility; and specific industry case studies
(including theoretical perspectives) have recently been carried out
for commercial banks [10], copying and imaging technology [11]
and instant messenger systems [6].
While these existing models of compatibility capture network
effects in the sense that the users in the market prefer to use 
technology that is more widespread, they do not capture the more 
finegrained network phenomenon represented by diffusion - that each
user is including its local view in the decision, based on what its
own social network neighbors are doing. A diffusion model that 
incorporated such extensions could provide insight into the structure
of boundaries in the network between technologies; it could 
potentially offer a graph-theoretic basis for how incompatibility may
benefit an existing technology, by strengthening these boundaries
and preventing the incursion of a new, better technology.
The present work: Diffusion with bilingual behavior. In this
paper, we develop a set of diffusion models that incorporate notions
of compatibility and bilinguality, and we find that some unexpected
phenomena emerge even from very simple versions of the models.
We begin with perhaps the simplest way of extending Morris"s
model discussed above to incorporate bilingual behavior. Consider
again the example of IM systems A and B, with the payoff 
structure as before, but now suppose that each node can adopt a third
strategy, denoted AB, in which it decides to use both A and B. An
adopter of AB gets to use, on an edge-by-edge basis, whichever
of A or B yields higher payoffs in each interaction, and the payoff
structure is defined according to this principle: if an adopter of AB
interacts with an adopter of B, both receive q; with an adopter of
A, both receive 1 − q; and with another adopter of AB, both 
receive max(q, 1 − q). Finally, an adopter of AB pays a fixed-cost
penalty of c (i.e. −c is added to its total payoff) to represent the
cost of having to maintain both technologies.
Thus, in this model, there are two parameters that can be varied:
the relative qualities of the two technologies (encoded by q), and
the cost of being bilingual, which reflects a type of incompatibility
(encoded by c).
Following [13] we assume the underlying graph G is infinite;
we further assume that for some natural number Δ, each node has
degree Δ.1
We are interested in the question posed at the outset, of
whether a new technology A can spread through a network where
almost everyone is initially using B. Formally, we say that strategy
A can become epidemic if the following holds: starting from a state
in which all nodes in a finite set S adopt A, and all other nodes
adopt B, a sequence of best-response updates (potentially with 
tiebreaking) in G − S causes every node to eventually adopt A. We
also introduce one additional bit of notation that will be useful in
the subsequent sections: we define r = c/Δ, the fixed penalty for
adopting AB, scaled so that it is a per-edge cost.
In the Morris model, where the only strategic options are A and
B, a key parameter is the contagion threshold of G, denoted q∗
(G):
this is the supremum of q for which A can become epidemic in
G with parameter q in the payoff structure. A central result of
[13] is that 1
2
is the maximum possible contagion threshold for any
graph: supG q∗
(G) = 1
2
. Indeed, there exist graphs in which the
contagion threshold is as large as 1
2
(including the infinite line - the
unique infinite connected 2-regular graph); on the other hand, one
can show there is no graph with a contagion threshold greater than
1
2
.
In our model where the bilingual strategy AB is possible, we
have a two-dimensional parameter space, so instead of a 
contagion threshold q∗
(G) we have an epidemic region Ω(G), which
is the subset of the (q, r) plane for which A can become epidemic
in G. And in place of the maximum possible contagion 
threshold supG q∗
(G), we must consider the general epidemic region
Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken over all infinite Δ-regular
graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) values for which A can become
epidemic in some Δ-regular network.
1
We can obtain strictly analogous results by taking a sequence of
finite graphs and expressing results asymptotically, but the use of
an infinite bounded-degree graph G makes it conceptually much
cleaner to express the results (as it does in Morris"s paper [13]): less
intricate quantification is needed to express the diffusion properties,
and the qualitative phenomena remain the same.

can become epidemic on the infinite line.
Our Results. We find, first of all, that the epidemic region Ω(G)
can be unexpectedly complex, even for very simple graphs G. 
Figure 1 shows the epidemic region for the infinite line; one observes
that neither the region Ω(G) nor its complement is convex in the
positive quadrant, due to the triangular cut-out shape. (We find
analogous shapes that become even more complex for other 
simple infinite graph structures; see for example Figures 3 and 4.) In
particular, this means that for values of q close to but less than 1
2
,
strategy A can become epidemic on the infinite line if r is 
sufficiently small or sufficiently large, but not if r takes values in some
intermediate interval. In other words, strategy B (which represents
the worse technology, since q < 1
2
) will survive if and only if the
cost of being bilingual is calibrated to lie in this middle interval.
This is a reflection of limited compatibility - that it may be in
the interest of an incumbent technology to make it difficult but not
too difficult to use a new technology - and we find it surprising
that it should emerge from a basic model on such a simple network
structure. It is natural to ask whether there is a qualitative 
interpretation of how this arises from the model, and in fact it is not hard to
give such an interpretation, as follows.
When r is very small, it is cheap for nodes to adopt AB as
a strategy, and so AB spreads through the whole network.
Once AB is everywhere, the best-response updates cause all
nodes to switch to A, since they get the same interaction 
benefits without paying the penalty of r.
When r is very large, nodes at the interface, with one A 
neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it too expensive to choose
AB, so they will choose A (the better technology), and hence
A will spread step-by-step through the network.
When r takes an intermediate value, a node v at the 
interface, with one A neighbor and one B neighbor, will find it
most beneficial to adopt AB as a strategy. Once this happens,
the neighbor of v who is playing B will not have sufficient
incentive to switch, and the best-response updates make no
further progress. Hence, this intermediate value of r allows
a boundary of AB to form between the adopters of A and
the adopters of B.
In short, the situation facing B is this: if it is too permissive, it gets
invaded by AB followed by A; if it is too inflexible, forcing nodes
to choose just one of A or B, it gets destroyed by a cascade of
direct conversions to A. But if it has the right balance in the value
of r, then the adoptions of A come to a stop at a bilingual boundary
where nodes adopt AB.
Moving beyond specific graphs G, we find that this non-convexity
holds in a much more general sense as well, by considering the 
general epidemic region Ω = ∪GΩ(G). For any given value of Δ, the
region Ω is a complicated union of bounded and unbounded 
polygons, and we do not have a simple closed-form description for it.
However, we can show via a potential function argument that no
point (q, r) with q > 1
2
belongs to Ω. Moreover, we can show the
existence of a point (q, r) ∈ Ω for which q < 1
2
. On the other hand,
consideration of the epidemic region for the infinite line shows that
(1
2
, r) ∈ Ω for r = 0 and for r sufficiently large. Hence, neither Ω
nor its complement is convex in the positive quadrant.
Finally, we also extend a characterization that Morris gave for
the contagion threshold [13], producing a somewhat more intricate
characterization of the region Ω(G). In Morris"s setting, without an
AB strategy, he showed that A cannot become epidemic with 
parameter q if and only if every cofinite set of nodes contains a subset
S that functions as a well-connected community: every node in
S has at least a (1 − q) fraction of its neighbors in S. In other
words, tightly-knit communities are the natural obstacles to 
diffusion in his setting. With the AB strategy as a further option, a more
complex structure becomes the obstacle: we show that A cannot 
become epidemic with parameters (q, r) if and only if every cofinite
set contains a structure consisting of a tightly-knit community with
a particular kind of interface of neighboring nodes. We show that
such a structure allows nodes to adopt AB at the interface and B
inside the community itself, preventing the further spread of A; and
conversely, this is the only way for the spread of A to be blocked.
The analysis underlying the characterization theorem yields a
number of other consequences; a basic one is, roughly speaking,
that the outcome of best-response updates is independent of the 
order in which the updates are sequenced (provided only that each
node attempts to update itself infinitely often).
Further Extensions. Another way to model compatibility and 
interoperability in diffusion models is through the off-diagonal terms
representing the payoff for interactions between a node adopting A
and a node adopting B. Rather than setting these to 0, we can 
consider setting them to a value x ≤ min(q, 1 − q). We find that
for the case of two technologies, the model does not become more
general, in that any such instance is equivalent, by a re-scaling of
q and r, to one where x = 0. Moreover, using our 
characterization of the region Ω(G) in terms of communities and interfaces, we
show a monotonicty result: if A can become epidemic on a graph
G with parameters (q, r, x), and then x is increased, then A can
still become epidemic with the new parameters.
We also consider the effect of these off-diagonal terms in an 
extension to k > 2 competing technologies; for technologies X and
Y , let qX denote the payoff from an X-X interaction on an edge
and qXY denote the payoff from an X-Y interaction on an edge.
We consider a setting in which two technologies B and C, which
initially coexist with qBC = 0, face the introduction of a third,
better technology A at a finite set of nodes. We show an example
in which B and C both survive in equilibrium if they set qBC in
a particular range of values, but not if they set qBC too low or too
high to lie in this range. Thus, in even in a basic diffusion model
with three technologies, one finds cases in which two firms have an
incentive to adopt a limited strategic alliance, partially increasing
their interoperability to defend against a new entrant in the market.
2. MODEL
We now develop some further notation and definitions that will
be useful for expressing the model. Recall that we have an infinite
Δ-regular graph G, and strategies A, B, and AB that are used in
a coordination game on each edge. For edge (v, w), the payoff
77
to each endpoint is 0 if one of the two nodes chooses strategy A
and the other chooses strategy B; 1 − q if one chooses strategy A
and the other chooses either A or AB; q if one chooses strategy B
and the other chooses either B or AB; and max(q, 1 − q) if both
choose strategy AB. The overall payoff of an agent v is the sum of
the above values over all neighbors w of v, minus a cost which is 0
if v chooses A or B and c = rΔ if she chooses AB. We refer to
the overall game, played by all nodes in G, as a contagion game,
and denote it using the tuple (G, q, r).
This game can have many Nash equilibria. In particular, the
two states where everybody uses technology A or everybody uses
technology B are both equilibria of this game. As discussed in
the previous section, we are interested in the dynamics of reaching
an equilibrium in this game; in particular, we would like to know
whether it is possible to move from an all-B equilibrium to an all-A
equilibrium by changing the strategy of a finite number of agents,
and following a sequence of best-response moves.
We provide a formal description of this question via the 
following two definitions.
DEFINITION 2.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A state
in this game is a strategy profile s : V (G) → {A, B, AB}. For
two states s and s and a vertex v ∈ V (G), if starting from state s
and letting v play her best-response move (breaking ties in favor of
A and then AB) we get to the state s , we write s
v
→ s . Similarly,
for two states s and s and a finite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . , vk of
vertices of G (where vi"s are not necessarily distinct), we say s
S
→
s if there is a sequence of states s1, . . . , sk−1 such that s
v1
→ s1
v2
→
s2
v3
→ · · · sk−1
vk
→ s . For an infinite sequence S = v1, v2, . . . of
vertices of G, we denote the subsequence v1, v2, . . . , vk by Sk. We
say s
S
→ s for two states s and s if for every vertex v ∈ V (G)
there exists a k0(v) such that for every k > k0(v), s
Sk
→ sk for a
state sk with sk(v) = s (v).
DEFINITION 2.2. For T ⊆ V (G), we denote by sT the strategy
profile that assigns A to every agent in T and B to every agent in
V (G) \ T. We say that technology A can become an epidemic in
the game (G, q, r) if there is a finite set T of nodes in G (called the
seed set) and a sequence S of vertices in V (G) \ T (where each
vertex can appear more than once) such that sT
S
→ sV (G), i.e.,
endowing agents in T with technology A and letting other agents
play their best response according to schedule S would lead every
agent to eventually adopt strategy A.2
The above definition requires that the all-A equilibrium be 
reachable from the initial state by at least one schedule S of best-response
moves. In fact, we will show in Section 4 that if A can become
an epidemic in a game, then for every schedule of best-response
moves of the nodes in V (G) \ T in which each node is scheduled
an infinite number of times, eventually all nodes adopt strategy A.3
3. EXAMPLES
We begin by considering some basic examples that yield 
epidemic regions with the kinds of non-convexity properties discussed
2
Note that in our definition we assume that agents in T are endowed
with the strategy A at the beginning. Alternatively, one can define
the notion of epidemic by allowing agents in T to be endowed with
any combination of AB and A, or with just AB. However, the
difference between these definitions is rather minor and our results
carry over with little or no change to these alternative models.

Note that we assume agents in the seed set T cannot change their
strategy.

Figure 2: The thick line graph
in Section 1. We first discuss a natural Δ-regular generalization of
the infinite line graph, and for this one we work out the complete
analysis that describes the region Ω(G), the set of all pairs (q, r)
for which the technology A can become an epidemic. We then 
describe, without the accompanying detailed analysis, the epidemic
regions for the infinite Δ-regular tree and for the two-dimensional
grid.
The infinite line and the thick line graph. For a given even 
integer Δ, we define the thick line graph LΔ as follows: the vertex
set of this graph is Z × {1, 2, . . . , Δ/2}, where Z is the set of all
integers. There is an edge between vertices (x, i) and (x , i ) if and
only if |x − x | = 1. For each x ∈ Z, we call the set of vertices
{(x, i) : i ∈ {1, . . . , Δ/2} the x"th group of vertices. Figure 2
shows a picture of L6
Now, assume that starting from a position where every node uses
the strategy B, we endow all agents in a group (say, group 0) with
the strategy A. Consider the decision faced by the agents in group
1, who have their right-hand neighbors using B and their left-hand
neighbors using A. For these agents, the payoffs of strategies A,
B, and AB are (1 − q)Δ/2, qΔ/2, and Δ/2 − rΔ, respectively.
Therefore, if
q ≤
1
2
and q ≤ 2r,
the best response of such an agent is A. Hence, if the above 
inequality holds and we let agents in groups 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . play
their best response in this order, then A will become an epidemic.
Also, if we have q > 2r and q ≤ 1 − 2r, the best response of
an agent with her neighbors on one side playing A and neighbors
on the other side playing B is the strategy AB. Therefore, if we
let agents in groups 1 and −1 change to their best response, they
would switch their strategy to AB. After this, agents in group 2
will see AB on their left and B on their right. For these agents
(and similarly for the agents in group −2), the payoff of strategies
A, B, and AB are (1−q)Δ/2, qΔ, and (q+max(q, 1−q))Δ/2−
rΔ, respectively. Therefore, if max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 1 − q and
max(1, 2q) − 2r ≥ 2q, or equivalently, if
2r ≤ q and q + r ≤
1
2
,
the best response of such an agent is AB. Hence, if the above
inequality holds and we let agents in groups 2, −2, 3, −3 . . . play
their best response in this order, then every agent (except for agents
in group 0) switches to AB. Next, if we let agents in groups
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . change their strategy again, for q ≤ 1/2, 
every agent will switch to strategy A, and hence A becomes an 
epidemic.4

Strictly speaking, since we defined a schedule of moves as
a single infinite sequence of vertices in V (G) \ T, the order
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . is not a valid schedule. 
However, since vertices of G have finite degree, it is not hard to see
that any ordering of a multiset containing any (possibly infinite)

The above argument shows that for any combination of (q, r)
parameters in the marked region in Figure 1, technology A can
become an epidemic. It is not hard to see that for points outside
this region, A cannot become epidemic.
Further examples: trees and grids. Figures 3 and 4 show the
epidemic regions for the infinite grid and the infinite Δ-regular tree.
Note they also exhibit non-convexities.
4. CHARACTERIZATION
In this section, we characterize equilibrium properties of 
contagion games. To this end, we must first argue that contagion games
in fact have well-defined and stable equilibria. We then discuss
some respects in which the equilibrium reached from an initial state
is essentially independent of the order in which best-response 
updates are performed.
We begin with the following lemma, which proves that agents
eventually converge to a fixed strategy, and so the final state of a
game is well-defined by its initial state and an infinite sequence of
moves. Specifically, we prove that once an agent decides to adopt
technology A, she never discards it, and once she decides to discard
technology B, she never re-adopts it. Thus, after an infinite number
of best-response moves, each agent converges to a single strategy.
LEMMA 4.1. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a 
(possibly infinite) subset T ⊆ V (G) of agents. Let sT be the strategy
profile assigning A to every agent in T and B to every agent in
V (G) \ T. Let S = v1, v2, . . . be a (possibly infinite) sequence of
number of copies of each vertex of V (G) \ T can be turned
into an equivalent schedule of moves. For example, the sequence
1, −1, 2, −2, 1, −1, 3, −3, 2, −2, . . . gives the same outcome as
1, −1, 2, −2, . . . , 1, −1, 2, −2, . . . in the thick line example.
agents in V (G) \ T and consider the sequence of states s1, s2, . . .
obtained by allowing agents to play their best-response in the order
defined by S (i.e., s
v1
→ s1
v2
→ s2
v3
→ · · · ). Then for every i, one of
the following holds:
• si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = A,
• si(vi+1) = B and si+1(vi+1) = AB,
• si(vi+1) = AB and si+1(vi+1) = A,
• si(vi+1) = si+1(vi+1).
PROOF. Let X >k
v Y indicate that agent v (weakly) prefers
strategy X to strategy Y in state sk. For any k let zk
A, zk
B, and zk
AB
be the number of neighbors of v with strategies A, B, and AB in
state sk, respectively. Thus, for agent v in state sk,
1. A >k
v B if (1 − q)(zk
A + zk
AB) is greater than q(zk
B + zk
AB),
2. A >k
v AB if (1− q)(zk

v B if (1−q)zk

B +max(q, 1−q)zk
AB −Δr
is greater than q(zk
B + zk
AB).
Suppose the lemma is false and consider the smallest i such that the
lemma is violated. Let v = vi+1 be the agent who played her best
response at time i. Thus, either 1. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = B,
or 2. si(v) = A and si+1(v) = AB, or 3. si(v) = AB and
si+1(v) = B. We show that in the third case, agent v could not
have been playing a best response. The other cases are similar.
In the third case, we have si(v) = AB and si+1(v) = B. As
si(v) = AB, there must be a time j < i where sj
v
→ sj+1 and
sj+1(v) = AB. Since this was a best-response move for v, 
inequality 3 implies that (1 − q)zj

AB ≥ Δr.
Furthermore, as i is the earliest time at which the lemma is

and so, by inequality 3, B can not be a better response than AB for
v in state si.
COROLLARY 4.2. For every infinite sequence S of vertices in
V (G) \ T, there is a unique state s such that s0
S
→ s, where s0
denotes the initial state where every vertex in T plays A and every
vertex in V (G) \ T plays B.
Such a state s is called the outcome of the game (G, q, r) starting
from T and using the schedule S.
Equivalence of best-response schedules. Lemma 4.1 shows that
the outcome of a game is well-defined and unique. The following
theorems show that the outcome is also invariant to the dynamics,
or sequence of best-response moves, under certain mild conditions.
The first theorem states that if the all-A equilibrium is the outcome
of a game for some (unconstrained) schedule, then it is the outcome
for any schedule in which each vertex is allowed to move infinitely
many times. The second theorem states that the outcome of a game
is the same for any schedule of moves in which every vertex moves
infinitely many times.

THEOREM 4.3. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r), a subset
T ⊆ V (G), and a schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that
the outcome of the game is the all-A equilibrium. Then for any
schedule S of vertices in V (G) \ T such that every vertex in this
set occurs infinitely many times, the outcome of the game using the
schedule S is also the all-A equilibrium.
PROOF. Note that S is a subsequence of S . Let π : S → S be
the injection mapping S to its subsequence in S . We show for any
vi ∈ S, if vi switches to AB, then π(vi) switches to AB or A, and
if vi switches to A, then π(vi) switches to A (here v switches to
X means that after the best-response move, the strategy of v is X).
Suppose not and let i be the smallest integer such that the statement
doesn"t hold. Let zA, zB, and zAB be the number of neighbors of
vi with strategies A, B, and AB in the current state defined by S.
Define zA,zB, and zAB similarly for S . Then, by Lemma 4.1 and
the choice of i, zA ≥ zA, zB ≤ zB, zAB − zAB ≤ zB − zB, and
zAB − zAB ≤ zA − zA. Now suppose vi switches to AB. Then
the same sequence of inequalities as in Lemma 4.1 show that AB
is a better response than B for π(vi) (although A might be the best
response) and so π(vi) switches to either AB or A. The other case
(vi switches to A) is similar.
THEOREM 4.4. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r) and a 
subset T ⊆ V (G). Then for every two schedules S and S of vertices
in V (G)\T such that every vertex in this set occurs infinitely many
times in each of these schedules, the outcomes of the game using
these schedules are the same.
PROOF. The proof of this theorem is similar to that of 
theorem 4.3 and is deferred to the full version of the paper.
Blocking structures. Finally, we prove the characterization 
mentioned in the introduction: A cannot become epidemic if and only
if (G, q, r) possesses a certain kind of blocking structure. This 
result generalizes Morris"s theorem on the contagion threshold for
his model; in his case without AB as a possible strategy, a simpler
kind of community structure was the obstacle to A becoming
epidemic.
We begin by defining the blocking structures.
DEFINITION 4.5. Consider a contagion game (G, q, r). A pair
(SAB, SB) of disjoint subsets of V (G) is called a blocking 
structure for this game if for every vertex v ∈ SAB,
degSB
(v) >
r
q
Δ,
and for every vertex v ∈ SB,
(1 − q) degSB
(v) + min(q, 1 − q) degSAB
(v) > (1 − q − r)Δ,
and
degSB
(v) + q degSAB
(v) > (1 − q)Δ,
where degS(v) denotes the number of neighbors of v in the set S.
THEOREM 4.6. For every contagion game (G, q, r), 
technology A cannot become epidemic in this game if and only if every
co-finite set of vertices of G contains a blocking structure.
PROOF. We first show that if every co-finite set of vertices of
G contains a blocking structure, then technology A cannot become
epidemic. Let T be any finite set of vertices endowed with 
technology A, and let (SAB, SB) be the blocking structure contained
in V (G) \ T. We claim that in the outcome of the game for any 
sequence S of moves, the vertices in SAB have strategy B or AB and
the vertices in SB have strategy B. Suppose not and let v be the first
vertex in sequence S to violate this (i.e., v ∈ SAB switches to A or
v ∈ SB switches to A or AB). Suppose v ∈ SAB (the other cases
are similar). Let zA, zB, and zAB denote the number of neighbors
of v with strategies A, B, and AB respectively. As v is the first
vertex violating the claim, zA ≤ Δ− degSB
(v)− degSAB
(v) and
zB ≥ degSB
(v). We show AB is a better strategy than A for v.
To show this, we must prove that (1 − q)zA + qzB + max(q, 1 −
q)zAB − Δr > (1 − q)(zA + zAB) or, equivalently, the quantity
Q ≡ qzB + max(2q − 1, 0)zAB − Δr > 0:
Q = (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ − max(2q − 1, 0)zA
+(q − max(2q − 1, 0))zB
≥ (max(2q − 1, 0) − r)Δ + min(q, 1 − q) degSB
(v)
− max(2q − 1, 0)(Δ − degSB
(v) − degSAB
(v))
≥ [min(q, 1 − q) + max(2q − 1, 0)] degSB
(v) − rΔ
= q degSB
(v) − rΔ
> 0,
where the last inequality holds by the definition of the blocking
structure.
We next show that A cannot become epidemic if and only if 
every co-finite set of vertices contains a blocking structure. To 
construct a blocking structure for the complement of a finite set T of
vertices, endow T with strategy A and consider the outcome of
the game for any sequence S which schedules each vertex an 
infinite number of times. Let SAB be the set of vertices with 
strategy AB and SB be the set of vertices with strategy B in this
outcome. Note for any v ∈ SAB, AB is a best-response and so
is strictly better than strategy A, i.e. q degSB
(v) + max(q, 1 −
q) degSAB
−Δr > (1− q) degSAB
(v), from where it follows that
degSB
(v) > (rΔ)/q. The inequalities for the vertices v ∈ SB can
be derived in a similar manner.
A corollary to the above theorem is that for every infinite graph
G, the epidemic regions in the q-r plane for this graph is a finite
union of bounded and unbounded polygons. This is because the
inequalities defining blocking structures are linear inequalities in
q and r, and the coefficients of these inequalities can take only
finitely many values.
5. NON-EPIDEMIC REGIONS IN GENERAL
GRAPHS
The characterization theorem in the previous section provides
one way of thinking about the region Ω(G), the set of all (q, r)
pairs for which A can become epidemic in the game (G, q, r). We
now consider the region Ω = ∪GΩ(G), where the union is taken
over all infinite Δ-regular graphs; this is the set of all (q, r) 
values for which A can become epidemic in some Δ-regular network.
The analysis here uses Lemma 4.1 and an argument based on an
appropriately defined potential function.
The first theorem shows that no point (q, r) with q > 1
2
belongs
to Ω. Since q > 1
2
implies that the incumbent technology B is
superior, it implies that in any network, a superior incumbent will
survive for any level of compatibility.
THEOREM 5.1. For every Δ-regular graph G and parameters
q and r, the technology A cannot become an epidemic in the game
(G, q, r) if q > 1/2.
PROOF. Assume, for contradiction, that there is a Δ-regular
graph G and values q > 1/2 and r, a set T of vertices of G that are
initially endowed with the strategy A, and a schedule S of moves
for vertices in V (G) \ T such that this sequence leads to an all-A
equilibrium. We derive a contradiction by defining a non-negative
80
potential function that starts with a finite value and showing that
after each best response by some vertex the value of this function
decreases by some positive amount bounded away from zero. At
any state in the game, let XA,B denote the number of edges in G
that have one endpoint using strategy A and the other endpoint 
using strategy B. Furthermore, let nAB denote the number of agents
using the strategy AB. The potential function is the following:
qXA,B + cnAB
(recall c = Δr is the cost of adopting two technologies). Since G
has bounded degree and the initial set T is finite, the initial value
of this potential function is finite. We now show that every best
response move decreases the value of this function by some positive
amount bounded away from zero. By Lemma 4.1, we only need to
analyze the effect on the potential function for moves of the sort
described by the lemma. Therefore we have three cases: a node u
switches from strategy B to AB, a node u switches from strategy
AB to A, or a node u switches from strategy B to A. We consider
the first case here; the proofs for the other cases are similar.
Suppose a node u with strategy B switches to strategy AB. Let
zAB, zA, and zB denote the number of neighbors of u in partition
piece AB, A, and B respectively. Thus, recalling that q > 1/2, we
see u"s payoff with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff
with strategy AB is q(zAB + zB) + (1 − q)zA − c. In order for
this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that
(1 − q)zA ≥ c. (1)
Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces
a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are
removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of
partition piece AB is increased by one. This change will be 
negative so long as zA > c/q which holds by inequality 1 as q > (1−q)
for q > 1/2. Furthermore, as zA can take only finitely many values
(zA ∈ {0, 1, . . . , Δ}), this change is bounded away from zero.
This next theorem shows that for any Δ, there is a point (q, r) ∈
Ω for which q < 1
2
. This means that there is a setting of the 
parameters q and r for which the new technology A is superior, but for
which the incumbent technology is guaranteed to survive regardless
of the underlying network.
THEOREM 5.2. There exist q < 1/2 and r such that for every
contagion game (G, q, r), A cannot become epidemic.
PROOF. The proof is based on the potential function from 
Theorem 5.1:
qXA,B + cnAB.
We first show that if q is close enough to 1/2 and r is chosen 
appropriately, this potential function is non-increasing. Specifically,
let
q =
1
2
−
1
64Δ
and c = rΔ = α,
where α is any irrational number strictly between 3/64 and q.
Again, there are three cases corresponding to the three possible
strategy changes for a node u. Let zAB, zA, and zB denote the
number of neighbors of node u in partition piece AB, A, and B
respectively.
Case 1: B → AB. Recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff
with strategy B is q(zAB + zB) whereas his payoff with strategy
AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c. In order for this strategic
change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that
(1 − 2q)zAB + (1 − q)zA ≥ c. (2)
Now, notice that such a strategic change on the part of u induces
a change in the potential function of −qzA + c as zA edges are
removed from the XA,B edges between A and B and the size of
partition piece AB is increased by one. This change will be 
nonpositive so long as zA ≥ c/q. By inequality 2 and the fact that zA
is an integer,
zA ≥
‰
c
1 − q
−
(1 − 2q)zAB
1 − q
ı
.
Substituting our choice of parameters, (and noting that q ∈ [1/4, 1/2]
and zAB ≤ Δ), we see that the term inside the ceiling is less than
1 and at least 3/64
3/4
− 1/32
1/2
> 0. Thus, the ceiling is one, which is
larger than c/q.
Case 2: AB → A. Recalling that q < 1/2, we see u"s payoff
with strategy AB is (1 − q)(zAB + zA) + qzB − c whereas her
payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA). In order for this
strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the case that
qzB ≤ c. (3)
Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the 
potential function of qzB −c as zB edges are added to the XA,B edges
between A and B and the size of partition piece AB is decreased
by one. This change will be non-positive so long as zB ≤ c/q,
which holds by inequality 3.
Case 3: B → A. Note u"s payoff with strategy B is q(zAB +
zB) whereas his payoff with strategy A is (1 − q)(zAB + zA). In
order for this strategic change to improve u"s payoff, it must be the
case that
(1 − 2q)zAB ≥ qzB − (1 − q)zA. (4)
Such a strategic change on the part of u induces a change in the
potential function of q(zB − zA) as zA edges are removed and zB
edges are added to the XA,B edges between A and B. This change
will be negative so long as zB < zA. By inequality 4 and the fact
that zA is an integer,
zA ≥

qzB
1 − q
+
(1 − 2q)zAB
1 − q
.
Substituting our choice of parameters, it is easy to see that the term
inside the floor is at most zB + 1/4, and so the floor is at most
zB as zB is an integer. We have shown the potential function is
non-increasing for our choice of q and c. This implies the potential
function is eventually constant. As c is irrational and the 
remaining terms are always rational, both nAB and XA,B must remain
constant for the potential function as a whole to remain constant.
Suppose A is epidemic in this region. As nAB is constant and
A is epidemic, it must be that nAB = 0. Thus, the only moves
involve a node u switching from strategy B to strategy A. In order
for XA,B to be constant for such moves, it must be that zA (the
number of neighbors of u in A) equals zB (the number of neighbors
of u in B) and, as nAB = 0, we have that zA = zB = Δ/2. Thus,
the payoff of u for strategy A is (1 − q)zA < Δ/4 whereas her
payoff for strategy AB is (1−q)zA +qzB −c > Δ/2−q ≥ Δ/4.
This contradicts the assumption that u is playing her best response
by switching to A.
6. LIMITED COMPATIBILITY
We now consider some further ways of modeling compatibility
and interoperability. We first consider two technologies, as in the
previous sections, and introduce off-diagonal payoffs to capture
a positive benefit in direct A-B interactions. We find that this is
81
in fact no more general than the model with zero payoffs for A-B
interactions.
We then consider extensions to three technologies, identifying
situations in which two coexisting incumbent technologies may or
may not want to increases their mutual compatibility in the face of
a new, third technology.
Two technologies. A natural relaxation of the two-technology model
is to introduce (small) positive payoffs for A-B interaction; that is,
cross-technology communication yields some lesser value to both
agents. We can model this using a variable xAB representing the
payoff gathered by an agent with technology A when her 
neighbor has technology B, and similarly, a variable xBA representing
the payoff gathered by an agent with B when her neighbor has A.
Here we consider the special case in which these off-diagonal 
entries are symmetric, i.e., xAB = xBA = x. We also assume that
x < q ≤ 1 − q.
We first show that the game with off-diagonal entries is 
equivalent to a game without these entries, under a simple re-scaling of
q and r. Note that if we re-scale all payoffs by either an additive
or a multiplicative constant, the behavior of the game is unaffected.
Given a game with off-diagonal entries parameterized by q, r and x,
consider subtracting x from all payoffs, and scaling up by a factor
of 1/(1 − 2x). As can be seen by examining Table 1, the resulting
payoffs are exactly those of a game without off-diagonal entries,
parameterized by q = (q − x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x).
Thus the addition of symmetric off-diagonal entries does not 
expand the class of games being considered.
Table 1 represents the payoffs in the coordination game in terms
of these parameters.
Nevertheless, we can still ask how the addition of an off-diagonal
entry might affect the outcome of any particular game. As the 
following example shows, increasing compatibility between two 
technologies can allow one technology that was not initially epidemic
to become so.
EXAMPLE 6.1. Consider the contagion game played on a thick
line graph (see Section 3) with r = 5/32 and q = 3/8. In this
case, A is not epidemic, as can be seen by examining Figure 1,
since 2r < q and q + r > 1/2. However, if we insert symmetric
off-diagonal payoffs x = 1/4, we have a new game, equivalent to a
game parameterized by r = 5/16 and q = 1/4. Since q < 1/2
and q < 2r , A is epidemic in this game, and thus also in the game
with limited compatibility.
We now show that generally, if A is the superior technology (i.e.,
q < 1/2), adding a compatibility term x can only help A spread.
THEOREM 6.2. Let G be a game without compatibility, 
parameterized by r and q on a particular network. Let G be that same
game, but with an added symmetric compatibility term x. If A is
epidemic for G, then A is epidemic for G .
PROOF. We will show that any blocking structure in G is also
a blocking structure in G. By our characterization theorem, 
Theorem 4.6, this implies the desired result. We have that G is 
equivalent to a game without compatibility parameterized by q = (q −
x)/(1 − 2x) and r = r/(1 − 2x). Consider a blocking structure
(SB, SAB) for G . We know that for any v ∈ SAB, q dSB (v) >
r Δ. Thus
qdSB (v) > (q − x)dSB (v)
= q (1 − 2x)dSB (v)
> r (1 − 2x)Δ
= rΔ,
as required for a blocking structure in G. Similarly, the two 
blocking structure constraints for v ∈ SB are only strengthened when
we move from G to G.
More than two technologies. Given the complex structure 
inherent in contagion games with two technologies, the understanding of
contagion games with three or more technologies is largely open.
Here we indicate some of the technical issues that come up with
multiple technologies, through a series of initial results. The 
basic set-up we study is one in which two incumbent technologies B
and C are initially coexisting, and a third technology A, superior
to both, is introduced initially at a finite set of nodes.
We first present a theorem stating that for any even Δ, there is
a contagion game on a Δ−regular graph in which the two 
incumbent technologies B and C may find it beneficial to increase their
compatibility so as to prevent getting wiped out by the new 
superior technology A. In particular, we consider a situation in which
initially, two technologies B and C with zero compatibility are at
a stable state. By a stable state, we mean that no finite 
perturbation of the current states can lead to an epidemic for either B or
C. We also have a technology A that is superior to both B and C,
and can become epidemic by forcing a single node to choose A.
However, by increasing their compatibility, B and C can maintain
their stability and resist an epidemic from A.
Let qA denote the payoffs to two adjacent nodes that both choose
technology A, and define qB and qC analogously. We will assume
qA > qB > qC . We also assume that r, the cost of selecting
additional technologies, is sufficiently large so as to ensure that
nodes never adopt more than one technology. Finally, we 
consider a compatibility parameter qBC that represents the payoffs
to two adjacent nodes when one selects B and the other selects
C. Thus our contagion game is now described by five parameters
(G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ).
THEOREM 6.3. For any even Δ ≥ 12, there is a Δ-regular
graph G, an initial state s, and values qA, qB, qC , and qBC , such
that
• s is an equilibrium in both (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) and
(G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ),
• neither B nor C can become epidemic in either
(G, qA, qB, qC , 0) or (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC ) starting from state
s,
• A can become epidemic (G, qA, qB, qC , 0) starting from state
s, and
• A can not become epidemic in (G, qA, qB, qC , qBC )
starting from state s.
PROOF. (Sketch.) Given Δ, define G by starting with an infinite
grid and connecting each node to its nearest Δ − 2 neighbors that
are in the same row. The initial state s assigns strategy B to even
rows and strategy C to odd rows. Let qA = 4k2
+ 4k + 1/2,
qB = 2k + 2, qC = 2k + 1, and qBC = 2k + 3/4. The first, third,
and fourth claims in the theorem can be verified by checking the
corresponding inequalities. The second claim follows from the first
and the observation that the alternating rows contain any plausible
epidemic from growing vertically.
The above theorem shows that two technologies may both be
able to survive the introduction of a new technology by increasing
their level of compatibility with each other. As one might expect,
82
A B AB
A (1 − q; 1 − q) (x; x) (1 − q; 1 − q − r)
B (x; x) (q; q) (q; q − r)
AB (1 − q − r; 1 − q) (q − r; q) (max(q, 1 − q) − r; max(q, 1 − q) − r)
Table 1: The payoffs in the coordination game. Entry (x, y) in row i, column j indicates that the row player gets a payoff of x and
the column player gets a payoff of y when the row player plays strategy i and the column player plays strategy j.
there are cases when increased compatibility between two 
technologies helps one technology at the expense of the other. 
Surprisingly, however, there are also instances in which compatibility
is in fact harmful to both parties; the next example considers a fixed
initial configuration with technologies A, B and C that is at 
equilibrium when qBC = 0. However, if this compatibility term is 
increased sufficiently, equilibrium is lost, and A becomes epidemic.
EXAMPLE 6.4. Consider the union of an infinite two-dimensional
grid graph with nodes u(x, y) and an infinite line graph with nodes
v(y). Add an edge between u(1, y) and v(y) for all y. For this 
network, we consider the initial configuration in which all v(y) nodes
select A, and node u(x, y) selects B if x < 0 and selects C 
otherwise.
We now define the parameters of this game as follows. Let qA =
3.95, qB = 1.25, qC = 1, and qBC = 0. It is easily verified that
for these values, the initial configuration given above is an 
equilibrium. However, now suppose we increase the coordination term,
setting qBC = 0.9. This is not an equilibrium, since each node of
the form u(0, y) now has an incentive to switch from C (generating
a payoff of 3.9) to B (thereby generating a payoff of 3.95). 
However, once these nodes have adopted B, the best-response for each
node of the form u(1, y) is A (A generates a payoff of 4 where as
B only generates a payoff of 3.95). From here, it is not hard to
show that A spreads directly throughout the entire network.
